update_notes: "## DSEins, the NDS version of 3DEins is now included as well!\r\n\r\
  \n## What's new?\r\n\r\n### DSEins\r\n- Add the initial release of DSEins, the NDS\
  \ version of 3DEins! This is it's first release, so it could be buggy, feel free\
  \ to report bugs, if there are any on the issue section or on the Universal-Server\
  \ [here](https://discord.gg/KDJCfGF).\r\nNOTE: This release is NOT really much graphical,\
  \ but the next version will be better for sure.\r\n\r\n### 3DEins\r\n- Add a draw\
  \ and play animation (can be enabled / disabled in the Settings.)\r\n\r\n### 3DEins\
  \ & DSEins\r\n- Use DSEins / 3DEins-Core which is made by me, StackZ. The core includes\
  \ a proper cardset of 108 cards.. like the regular game! So that way.. you cannot\
  \ have like 6 times Draw 4 which is a nice improvement to the old version!\r\n\r\
  \n- Added Single Player mode with AI!\r\n\r\n- Full Translations of: Bruh, English,\
  \ French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese and Russian!\r\n\r\n## How\
  \ to update\r\n### DSEins\r\n* Download `DSEins.nds` and put it to your SD Card.\r\
  \n* Start it using Twilight Menu++ or whatever you like.\r\n**3DS User: You can\
  \ install the CIA as well, but you need the NDS file as well into the root or at\
  \ `sd:/_nds/DSEins/`.**\r\n\r\n### 3DEins\r\n* Download `3DEins.3dsx` or `3DEins.cia`\
  \ and put it to your SD Card.\r\n* If downloading the CIA, install it using FBI.\
  \ If 3dsx, open it using the Homebrew Launcher.\r\n\r\n### We hope you enjoy using\
  \ DSEins & 3DEins v0.2.0! ~Universal-Team"
