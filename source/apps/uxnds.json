	"long_description": "Unxds is a port of the [Unx virtual machine](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html) to the 3DS. Uxn is a portable 8-bit virtual computer inspired by [forth-machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)), capable of running simple tools and games programmable in its own [assembly language](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html).\n\nThis emulator allows you run to your uxn projects on the 3DS, it can also be used for developers who want to learn how to program little 8-bit things.\n\nIt was designed with an implementation-first mindset with a focus on creating portable graphical applications, the distribution of Uxn projects is akin to sharing game roms for any classic console emulator.\n\n### Usage\nBy default, uxnds will run /uxn/boot.rom or /uxn/launcher.rom. It also supports reading files from within /uxn.\n\nOn start, a keyboard is presented on the bottom screen, and the uxn display - on the top screen. Use the L or R buttons to swap them - in this configuration, mouse input is approximated via touchscreen.\n\nYou can use the system button in the lower-left corner to reset the uxn virtual machine.\n\n### Installation\nTwo ports are provided: the 3DS port (compatible with 3DS consoles) and the NDS port (compatible with DS, DSi and 3DS consoles).\n\n#### 3DS port\nThere is one binary provided: uxnds.3dsx.\n\n#### NDS port\nWhen using a real DS, DSi or 3DS console, it is recommended to launch this program via [nds-hb-menu](https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-hb-menu) - though, as it currently doesn't use argc/argv, it doesn't really change much.\n\nThere are three binaries provided:\n- uxnds.nds - faster, but best used only with known-good software,\n- uxnds_debug.nds - slower, but provides debugging information, profiling information and performs CPU stack bounds checks.\n- uxnds_profile.nds - almost as fast as uxnds.nds - with debugging/profiling information, no CPU stack bounds checks.\n",
