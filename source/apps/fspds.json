	"long_description": "A DS ROM which allows playing DSi's Flipnote Studio (.ppm) files on a DS Phat/Lite. It features flipnote image and sound player with pause/resume option, and also a file metadata viewer.\n\nPlace the flipnotes you want to play in a `/flipnotes/` folder at the root of your SD card. FSPDS will not detect/play files larger than 1MB. It is also possible the app won't play correctly files with more than 512KB of BGM soundtrack (although I have never met such a file during my tests).",
