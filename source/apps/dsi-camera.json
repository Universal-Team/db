	"long_description": "This is just a simple proof of concept/example to show off the DSi's cameras being used in a homebrew app, and an open-source example for initializing the cameras in C/C++. Currently it can show both cameras and save a picture as to `sd:/DCIM/100DSI00/IMG_####.PNG`.\n\n![Example image](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/dsi-camera/raw/master/resources/example.png)"
