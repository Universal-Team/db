It can manage titles on both [hiyaCFW](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/hiyacfw/)'s SDNAND and your actual internal memory, typically called SysNAND. **When using in SysNAND mode please use with caution**.\n\nPlease see the [guide on the wiki](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/NTM/wiki/How-to-Install-DSiWare) for how to properly and safely use NTM.",
