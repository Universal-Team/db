	"long_description": "## *The wildest racing game since man invented the wheel!*\n\nThis is a port of Pangea Software’s racing game **Cro-Mag Rally** to the Nintendo 3DS, based off [Jorio's amazing port](https://github.com/jorio/CroMagRally). It is a fun, retro Mario Kart-style racing game.\n\n## About Cro-Mag Rally\n\nIn Cro-Mag Rally you are a speed-hungry caveman named Brog who races through the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages in primitive vehicles such as the Geode Cruiser, Bone Buggy, Logmobile, Trojan Horse, and many others. Brog has at his disposal an arsenal of primitive weaponry ranging from Bone Bombs to Chinese Bottle Rockets and Heat Seeking Homing Pigeons.\n\nCMR was released in 2000 by Pangea Software as a Mac exclusive, and it was a pack-in game on Macs that came out around that time.\n\n## Nintendo 3DS Controls\n* D-Pad: navigate menus\n* A: forward\n* B: reverse\n* X: look behind\n* Y: brake\n* L-Shoulder: throw backwards\n* R-Shoulder: throw forwards\n* Select: change camera\n* Start: pause\n\n## About this port\n\nThis is a port of the original OS 9 version of the game. It aims to provide the best way to experience CMR on today’s computers. It is an “enhanced” version insofar as it fixes bugs that may hinder the experience, and it brings in a few new features in keeping with the spirit of the original game.\n\n### Legal info\n\nCro-Mag Rally © 2000 Pangea Software, Inc.
