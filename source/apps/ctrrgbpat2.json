	"long_description": "# CtrRGBPAT2\nThis 3DS application allows the LED color to be changed. In order for this to work, Luma CFW (custom firmware) needs to be installed.\nThanks to [CPunch](https://github.com/CPunch/CtrRGBPATTY/) for the original project !\n\n## Features\nCustomize the LED color and pattern for when you receive notifications ! Whether SpotPass, StreetPass, online Friends, or more (Yes, there's more) ! Why keep the default blue when you can have a cool-looking purple for example ðŸ˜Ž\n\nEverything is simple and made so you cannot possibly screw something up (or else you really wanted to)\n\n## Upcoming\n- Save and restore feature\n- Proper UI ?\n\nHope you enjoy ! :)",
