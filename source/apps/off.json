	"long_description": "A 3DS port of **OFF,** the cult classic 2008 surrealist RPG by Mortis Ghost. Built via [Easy3DS.](https://github.com/msikma/Easy3DS)\n\n**This is based on the [v2.0 English translation by RecDra!](https://forum.starmen.net/forum/Fan/Games/OFF-by-Mortis-Ghost/page/3#post1907821)**\n\nI own nothing - this is strictly an unofficial fan project to help spread the word about this amazing game!\n**All rights belong to Mortis Ghost (Martin Georis), Alias Conrad Coldwood, & the Unproductive Fun Time team.**\n\n# Warning: Exiting the game\nWhen you want to quit, please do so via the \"quit\" option from the ingame menu, rather than closing the app directly from the 3DS homescreen!! Due to an error with the EasyRPG player, the latter method shuts down all processes and requires you to reboot your console, which is just really annoying (⁠-⁠_⁠-⁠;⁠)"
