It aims at least to somewhat replicate the 3DS version of Terraria, but with some features from the PC version, and some sacrifices to fit the DS hardware limitations.\n\nI'm trying as hard as possible to stay loyal to the original game design, but there are some limitations due to the DS hardware and the fact that this is a remake, not a port.\nAlso please note: For now, I'm prioritizing functionality over content.

If you can play on your own without a bot, the highscore would be easy to rig.\n- The game now goes back to the Start Menu when the game ends. Press start to leave the game.\n- _The options menu has become a sub-menu_. To access game modes, press Select at the Start Screen or End-of-Round Screen to access the Options menu, then select Game Modes, and press A. Press B to exit a menu.\n- _There is a Difficulty Menu for the bots_. From the new Options Menu, select the 2nd option (highlight it in yellow), and press A. Try using direction buttons and A to select and change things here. Press B to go back one scene.\n- _There is a hidden bot settings menu_. Hold L and press R at the Difficulty Menu. This will let you adjust fine details of each bot. However, if you go to the regular Difficulty Menu, it will reset their settings to default.\n- _Autopilot_ is also a bot, but it plays for you. Press L in-game to toggle. This bot has fixed settings: 100% precision, 0% aggressiveness, 30% patience. This means it will never go fast, but it is relatively difficult to kill in one-player. In local play, it can be killed a little easier due to limitations of its algorithm. \n- Bots can't grasp concepts like _Enable R_, but it utilizes common concepts like _holding A or B_, _teleporting the apple with Y_, and going through holes in \"Occasional holes\". The precision of the bot determines the likelihood of turning precisely. Insane and Autopilot share the highest precision, followed by Hard, Medium, then Easy difficulty settings.\n\n## Bug fixes:\n- _Frame drop on o3ds has been fixed_\n- _The rare crashing of the game has been fixed_\n- _Running into a boundary in game mode \"Boundaries Kill\" now displays what killed you._\n- _Snakes are less likely to cross paths now and live to tell the tale._\n- When you change your name, _it only says \"Welcome, [name]\" once_.\n- _The screen score no longer duplicates_ when text scrolls on the bottom screen console during gameplay.\n- _Closing the lid on your console with Snakes running will not crash the game anymore_. Pressing the Home button with the cia version running will not crash the game anymore.\n- Going in reverse will no longer kill you.\n\n**Just a note**: this game does not run very well on old 3ds models. It is playable, but with 3 bots playing at once, the o3ds has severe frame-drop. I am trying to find the source of this problem. It only occurs on the o3ds and o3dsxl. The n3ds and n3dsxl are fine.\n", "updated": "2017-01-24T22:01:22Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/snakes"], "version": "0.2.5", "version_title": "Version 0.2.5.2"}, {"author": "DS-Homebrew", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46971470?v=4", "categories": ["utility", "save-tool"], "color": "#be8345", "color_bg": "#80582e", "created": "2018-10-02T16:59:38Z", "description": "GodMode9i Explorer - A full access file browser for the Nintendo DS and DSi consoles :godmode:", "download_page": "https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases", "downloads": {"GodMode9i.7z": {"size": 372620, "size_str": "363 KiB", "url": "https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases/download/v3.9.0/GodMode9i.7z"}, "GodMode9i.cia": {"size": 1008896, "size_str": "985 KiB", "url": "https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases/download/v3.9.0/GodMode9i.cia"}, "GodMode9i.dsi": {"size": 994304, "size_str": "971 KiB", "url": "https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases/download/v3.9.0/GodMode9i.dsi"}, "GodMode9i.nds": {"size": 994304, "size_str": "971 KiB", "url": "https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases/download/v3.9.0/GodMode9i.nds"}}, "github": "DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i", "icon": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/icons/godmode9i.png", "icon_index": 38, "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/master/resources/logo2.png", "image_length": 44248, "installed_files": ["%NDS%/GodMode9i.nds"], "license": "gpl-3.0", "license_name": "GNU General Public License v3.0", "long_description": "### Installation:\n- TWiLight Menu++: Use either the `GodMode9i.nds` or `GodMode9i.dsi` file, they function identically with TWiLight Menu++\n   - The only difference is that `GodMode9i.dsi` has a Title ID\n- Flashcard: Use the `GodMode9i.nds` file\n- hiyaCFW SDNAND: Install the `GodMode9i.dsi` file with [NTM](/ds/ntm)\n- 3DS HOME Menu: Install the `GodMode9i.cia` file with [FBI](/3ds/fbi-nh)\n\n### Features:\n- Dump GameBoy Advance cartridges on the original Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite consoles.\n- Dump Nintendo DS/DSi cartridges on Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS consoles (if GodMode9i is ran on the console SD card).\n- Copy, move, delete, rename files/folders and create folders.\n- Mount the NitroFS of .nds files.\n- Browse files on supported flashcards when running GM9i from the NAND or SD Card.

Does that mean a fix for blargSNES is coming soon?\n\nUnfortunately, no, not because of this anyways. The reason why blargSNES has trouble with some audio in games is because of communication/sync problems (among other things) between the main CPU and SPC cores.\n\nSPC files you may find online were dumped by other emulators that don't have this problem. But, at least this shows that the audio can process/play once this issue with blargSNES is resolved.\n\nQ. Wait, I can play SPC files of games with enhancement chips in them. Does that mean...\n\nNo, it does not.

Outside of a spartan DVD release, the series produced no merchandise...\n\nUntil now.\n\nToday, I introduce you to Spirited DS, a barebones implementation of how I assume Top Trumps works, featuring 64x64 headshots of beloved Spirited characters, on the Nintendo DS. See how I feel these characters rate in 5 absolutely subjective qualities.\n\nDoes it fall under fair use? Who knows? But I don't think I'm causing much damage to a thirteen year old series on a sub-240p display, even if there are two of them.\n\nThe game is provided as a .nds file, suitable for a flashcart, modded 3DS, or emulator of your choice.\n\nTragically, there is no sound. Anyone who can help with that probably has better things to do.\n\nBuilt with NightFoxLib (which feeds off of DevKitPro, LibNDS). Code was written in C++ in Notepad. Python was used to test some logic, and to process pictures from Krita.\n\nBasic rules are: You pick one of five qualities listed on your card. If your value is bigger than your opponent's you win their card, and both cards go to the bottom of your deck. Lose, and it's your opponent's turn. They play by the same rules, and the game ends when one player has no more cards. It was primitive and dated even by late-seventies standards.", "qr": {"spirited_ds.nds": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/spirited_ds-nds.png"}, "slug": "spiritedds", "source":

It's originally a game that came bundled with Windows from Windows 95 up to Windows XP. This is the current state of the project:\n\n- No menus, options, or results screen.\n- It plays sound effects and music (if the player supplies the music in OGG format).\n- There are still some bugs here and there.\n- It should be running fine on New 3DS, but on a regular 3DS it runs slow.\n\nIt is based on the PC decompilation made by [k4zmu2a](https://github.com/k4zmu2a): https://github.com/k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball\n\nThe PC decompilation uses SDL2 to render the game. This 3DS port has been changed to use native GPU rendering with the Citro3D library.\n\n## How to build\n\nThe main requirement is to have [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org).\n\nFollow the instructions to install devkitPro here: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started\nYou will also need the 3DS development package, and also the libraries 3ds-sdl and 3ds-sdl_mixer.\n\nIf you use Windows or Ubuntu, here are more detailed instructions.\n\n### Windows\n\nEven though devkitPro offers a Windows installer, I've had some issues setting it up. It's easier to use WSL. If you want to use the Windows installer anyway, check the link above for instructions.\n\n1. Install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). By default it will install Ubuntu, which is fine.\n2. Open a WSL terminal and just follow the Ubuntu instructions below. With the difference that, if you want to clone the project into, for example, the `C:\\` folder, you will need move to that folder inside the terminal with the command `cd /mnt/c/`.\n\n### Ubuntu and other Debian based linux distros\n\n1. Open the terminal in the folder where you want to clone the project.\n2. Clone it with the command `git clone --branch 3ds https://github.com/MaikelChan/SpaceCadetPinball`. A subfolder called `SpaceCadetPinball` will be created containing the project.\n3. Move to that subfolder with `cd SpaceCadetPinball`.\n4. Download the latest version of the [custom devkitPro pacman](https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases/tag/v1.0.2), that will be used to download the compilers and libraries to build the project. Once downloaded, put it in the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder.\n5. Install devkitPro pacman with this command: `sudo gdebi devkitpro-pacman.amd64.deb`. If gdebi is not found, install it with `sudo apt install gdebi-core`, and then try again installing pacman.\n6. Use the following command to sync pacman databases: `sudo dkp-pacman -Sy`.\n7. Now update packages with `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu`.\n8. Install the 3DS development tools with `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev`.\n9. Install SDL with `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-sdl`.\n10. Install SDL_mixer with `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-sdl_mixer`.\n11. Set the DEVKITPRO environment variables so the system knows where the compilers and libraries are installed with these commands:\n    - `export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro`.\n    - `export DEVKITARM=/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM`.\n12. To generate Build the project with the command `make -j4`.\n13. Optionally, to generate a CIA file, you will need to have [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases/) and [makerom](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases) in the `$DEVKITPRO/tools/bin` folder. Then build the project with the command `make -j4 BUILD_CIA=1`.\n\nAfter a successful build, you will get a file called `SpaceCadetPinball.3dsx`, which is the main executable.\n\n## How to run\n\n### 3DS with Homebrew Launcher\n\n1. Go to your SD card and enter the `3ds` folder.\n2. Copy `SpaceCadetPinbal.3dsx` into the `3ds` folder.\n3. Make sure you have your `dspfirm.cdc` in the `3ds` folder, as you will need it to have sound in homebrew games. If you don't have it, [dump your DSP](https://github.com/zoogie/DSP1/releases/latest).\n4. Inside the `3ds` folder, create a new folder named `SpaceCadetPinball`.\n5. For legal reasons, you will need to get the original PC game on your own to obtain the assets like graphics and sound effects. Those are not contained in this repository.\n6. Copy all files from the original PC version into the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder that was created earlier.\n7. Optionally, since this port doesn't play MIDI files, you'll need to convert the music to ogg format, and call the file `PINBALL.ogg`, and put it along the other assets in the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder. Make sure that the music has a sample rate no higher than 44100Hz, or it won't play correctly.\n8. If everything went fine, you should be able to run the game from the Homebrew Launcher.\n\n### Citra\n\n1. Get the [Citra emulator](https://citra-emu.org/download/) if you don't have it.\n2. Open it and go to the menu `File/Open Citra Folder`. This will open the folder where Citra's configuration is stored.\n3. Go to the `sdmc` folder and create a new folder there named `3ds` if it doesn't exist already.\n4. Enter the `3ds` folder and create an empty file there named `dspfirm.cdc`. This will allow to have audio in homebrew apps.\n5. Inside the `3ds` folder create another folder named `SpaceCadetPinball`.\n6. For legal reasons, you will need to get the original PC game on your own to obtain the assets like graphics and sound effects. Those are not contained in this repository.\n7. Copy all PC game's assets to the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder that was created earlier.\n8. Optionally, since this port doesn't play MIDI files, you'll need to convert the music to ogg format, and call the file `PINBALL.ogg`, and put it along the other assets in the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder. Make sure that the music has a sample rate no higher than 44100Hz, or it won't play correctly.\n9.

not feasible.\n\n## Effects\n\nIf qtm was broken without this patch applied, it will still be broken with this patch applied, and so Super-Stable 3D will not work. From my case, the 3D projection with this patch applied will behave as if Super-Stable 3D is turned off. Additionally, your cameras are unlikely to work and software which attempts to use them will likely crash or hang.\n\n## Installation\n\nMade for the latest version of qtm, v3072. That comes with a system firmware of at least 11.5.0-38, released July 10<sup>th</sup>, 2017.\n\nIf you believe your firmware may be too out of date, you can run System Update in Safe Mode by holding `L + R + Up + A` on boot. Safe Mode does not load qtm, so it can work without this patch.\n\n### Luma3DS v13 or newer\n\n1. Download `0004013000004202.ips` from the latest release.\n1. Copy `0004013000004202.ips` into `SD:/luma/sysmodules/`, creating folders as necessary. Ensure that its filename is preserved.\n1. Enable the Luma setting `Enable loading external FIRMs and modules`, such as by using the menu accessed by holding Select on boot.\n\n### Older Luma3DS versions\n\n1. Download `0004013000004202.ips` from the latest release.\n1. Rename `0004013000004202.ips` to `code.ips`.\n1. Copy `code.ips` into `SD:/luma/titles/0004013000004202/`, creating folders as necessary.\n1.

You have to find a path through the levels that doesn't involve getting sent back to the start via (example) touching a lava tile. The simple nature of **Cube Adventures** makes it playable on every 3DS console in the family (including the 2DS systems).\n\n### Controls\nThis game features incredibly simple controls making it really easy to get used to. Although the controls can be seen on the bottom screen during gameplay, I'll also list them here:\n**A** = Jump / Menu Select\n**DPAD Left** & **DPAD Right** = Move Left & Right\n**START** = Return to main menu\n**R**+**L** = Toggle dev mode\n**SELECT** = Change level (Only usable while dev mode is active)\nPS: More information can be found about dev mode in the _features_ section below.\n\n## Features:\n### Sprites\n**Cube Adventures** features an incredibly simple graphics style. This is due to the lack of sprites the game uses. **Cube Adventures** only uses colors and squares to display images onto the screen making it incredibly simple and graphically simple to run.\n\n### Levels\n**Cube Adventures** features a number of unique levels for you to explore with the ability to make your own levels by compiling the game for yourself if you so choose. Its as easy as putting `1`s where you want ground to be and `0`s where you want nothing to be.\n\n### Dev Mode\n**Cube Adventures** makes compiling your own version of the game very simple as it gives you access to a feature called \"Dev Mode\". All _Dev Mode_ does is displays the current **x** & **y velocity** as well as the current coordinates to you on the bottom screen. This is extremely helpful when you start placing down coins and other items into the levels that you make.\n\n## Final Words:\nI want to thank you for checking out my game **Cube Adventures** and I hope you enjoy it.

After much arduous work, I'm thrilled to finally share a brand new port of PrBoom+ to the 3DS!\n\nThis is more or less a straight port of PrBoom+ 2.6.66, with some extra added enhancements exclusive to the system.\nJust about everything you'd expect desktop PrBoom+ to do, this port should also be able to do.\nThe only things it can't do are a few unsupported renderer features (which have been stripped out anyway) and networking features.\nIn addition, all video modes apart from 8-bit are supported. By default, the GPU-accelerated OpenGL mode is enabled, though the other software-rendering modes are also available should you wish to fall back on them (so far, all modes produce roughly similar performance, with OpenGL being moderately faster)\n\nFeatures:\n-PrBoom+ 2.6.66\n-Features both GPU-accelerated OpenGL mode, and software-renderer modes\n-Great performance on New 3DS, decent-ish performance on Old 3DS\n-Good quality stereoscopic 3D (OpenGL mode only)\n-Interchangeable touchscreen mouse and keyboard\n(with touchscreen mouse, you can drag to look around, tap the screen to fire, and double-tap and hold to keep firing - ideal for Old 3DS)", "qr": {"PrBoom-Plus.cia": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/prboom-plus-cia.png"}, "screenshots": [{"description": "Gameplay

Master the art of the cook on your Nintendo DS system and prepare the perfect batch&mdash;lest you meet the wrong end of Gus. Hone your cook in both Singleplayer and Local Multiplayer Vs.\n\n## Instructions\n### Tutorial (1P)\nThe Tutorial will teach you how to play! Gale will provide instructions on how to complete each Minigame. To access the Tutorial, select it from the Main Menu.\n\n### Story Mode (1P)\nTo start story mode, start the game. Touch to start, then tap \"Start Game → Story Mode.\"\n\nGus has appointed you Head Cook! Meet his ever-increasing demands by cooking against the clock in the Superlab. Each day, you'll be given a Quota you must complete within a set time limit to progress on to the next day. After each day, you'll receive your pay packet based on your performance and efficiency, which you can spend in Saul's shop!\n\nStory mode lasts five days, and there are two possible endings (\"Good\" and \"Bad\"). Good luck!\n\n### Local Multiplayer (2P)\nBreaking Bad for Nintendo DS also supports up to two Nintendo DS systems playing together in a Multiplayer Vs. Battle to see who can complete their batches the quickest. To set this up:\n\n* On the first system, launch the game. Touch to start, then tap \"Start Game → Host.\"\n* On the second system, launch the game, touch to start, then tap \"Start Game → Join.\"\n* Wait for the systems to establish communications.\n* On the Host console, press the A Button to start the game.\n\nThe Host system will play as Walter, while the guest will play as Jesse. The magic that makes it work is thanks to the incredible [Fewnity](https://github.com/Fewnity/Nintendo-DS-Nifi-Template/)'s amazing NiFi scaffold!\n\n### Hank's Minerals\nBy completing certain challenges, you'll find minerals! Hank will appraise minerals you find in the \"Hank's Minerals\" submenu, located in the Extras Menu. There are twelve minerals to find, and you can view how to get them by tapping on each `[?]` icon in the menu.\n\nOnce you've obtained a mineral, it will be displayed in the menu and selecting it will tell you what it is. Minerals marked with \"??????\" are a secret, so no hints there!\n\n### Music Player\nYou can listen to the game music through the Music Player submenu, located in the Extras menu. Use the left and right buttons on the + Control Pad to change the track.", "nightly": {"download_page": "https://github.com/WiIIiam278/breaking-bad-ds/actions", "downloads": {"Breaking Bad DS.zip": {"url": "https://nightly.link/WiIIiam278/breaking-bad-ds/workflows/ci/main/Breaking%20Bad%20DS.zip"}}}, "qr": {"breaking-bad-ds.nds": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/breaking-bad-ds-nds.png"}, "screenshots": [{"description": "Hanks minerals", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/hanks-minerals.png"}, {"description": "In the lab", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/in-the-lab.png"}, {"description": "Minigame", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/minigame.png"}, {"description": "Multiplayer vs", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/multiplayer-vs.png"}, {"description": "Story mode", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/story-mode.png"}, {"description": "Title screen", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/title-screen.png"}], "slug": "breaking-bad-ds", "source": "https://github.com/WiIIiam278/breaking-bad-ds", "stars": 183, "systems": ["DS"], "title": "Breaking Bad DS", "update_notes": "<h2 dir=\"auto\">Change notes</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Updated dialogue with Gus and Gale\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Fixed a few spelling mistakes (addage -&gt; adage, apologise -&gt; apologize)</li>\n<li>Fixed Gale's introductory text implying you have already turned the ventilation valve</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed save data sometimes not correctly tracking the state of the game</li>\n<li>Improved the stability of the game ending logic\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Added a failsafe dialogue state check before end-of-day dialogue on Day 5</li>\n<li>The game will now forcibly defrag the VRAM sprite buffers before displaying the End Screen</li>\n<li>The game will now award the \"Completed Story Mode\" mineral achievement before displaying the End Screen</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where the mineral selection sound effect on Hank's Minerals screen would play multiple times, would still play if a mineral was not selected, and would also still play if the same mineral was selected</li>\n<li>Added sound effects to the \"cracking\" minigame; the \"pestle hit\" effect will now also play when a critical hit/golden hammer hit is landed on a section or crystal of methamphetamine product</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Playing</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For the absolute best experience, pop the ROM on a flashcart and enjoy!</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">On an Emulator</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">But if you're not as bothered as Walter is about doing things with the proper gear, <a href=\"https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS/releases/latest\">melonDS</a> is the recommended emulator for play due to its accuracy and performance.

It also supports reading files from within /uxn.\n\nOn start, a keyboard is presented on the bottom screen, and the uxn display - on the top screen. Use the L or R buttons to swap them - in this configuration, mouse input is approximated via touchscreen.\n\nYou can use the system button in the lower-left corner to reset the uxn virtual machine.\n\n### Installation\nTwo ports are provided: the 3DS port (compatible with 3DS consoles) and the NDS port (compatible with DS, DSi and 3DS consoles).\n\n#### 3DS port\nThere is one binary provided: uxnds.3dsx.\n\n#### NDS port\nWhen using a real DS, DSi or 3DS console, it is recommended to launch this program via [nds-hb-menu](https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-hb-menu) - though, as it currently doesn't use argc/argv, it doesn't really change much.\n\nThere are three binaries provided:\n- uxnds.nds - faster, but best used only with known-good software,\n- uxnds_debug.nds - slower, but provides debugging information, profiling information and performs CPU stack bounds checks.\n- uxnds_profile.nds - almost as fast as uxnds.nds - with debugging/profiling information, no CPU stack bounds checks.\n", "scripts": {"uxnds.3dsx": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/uxnds.3dsx", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn/", "output": "/uxn/", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn/", "output": "/uxn/", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_debug.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_debug.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_debug.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn/", "output": "/uxn/", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_profile.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_profile.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_profile.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn/", "output": "/uxn/", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}]}, "slug": "uxnds", "source": "https://github.com/asiekierka/uxnds", "stars": 167, "systems": ["3DS", "DS"], "title": "uxnds", "update_notes": "<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>[3DS] Update libctru to 2.4.1.</li>\n<li>[NDS] Update BlocksDS to 1.9.0.</li>\n<li>Synchronize <code class=\"notranslate\">file</code> peripheral implementation with upstream.</li>\n<li>Update bundled Uxn applications.</li>\n</ul>", "update_notes_md": "- [3DS] Update libctru to 2.4.1.\n- [NDS] Update BlocksDS to 1.9.0.\n- Synchronize `file` peripheral implementation with upstream.\n- Update bundled Uxn applications.", "updated": "2025-03-30T12:09:54Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/uxnds", "https://db.universal-team.net/ds/uxnds"], "version": "v0.5.3", "version_title": "uxnds 0.5.3", "website": "https://100r.co/site/uxn.html", "wiki": "https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html"}, {"author": "A.

While you're at it, why not also grab @ihaveamac’s `HelloScript.lua` from the `samples` folder and tinker around with it?\n\n**Special thanks**\nAnd here's to the part that always gives me the biggest headache. Because, with a project running as long as GodMode9 and having as many contributors as it does, mentioning and crediting everyone — developers, bug reporters, feature suggesters, people who offer advice or web hosting—is an impossible task. Just know that I’m thankful to everyone who has supported the project over the years.\n\nFor this release, special thanks go out to:  \n* @Wolfvak, for being a main dev at my side for almost the entire lifetime of GodMode9  \n* @ihaveamac, for adding Lua support and greatly expanding scripting capabilities, also for giving me the original idea for encryption restoration\n* @Epicpkmn11 and all translation contributors, who have been working for years to make GodMode9 available in multiple languages  \n* @luigoalma, for improving things for devkit users by finally fixing an AES key-related bug\n* @ZeroSkill1, for helping me a great deal understanding signature checking\n* @MisterSheeple, for helping me out with some testing\n* The fine folks on the [GodMode9 Discord](https://discord.gg/BRcbvtFxX4)\n* All [3dbrew.org](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page) contributors\n* Martin Korth for [GBATEK](https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm)", "updated":

It is a Star Raiders-like remake for the Nintendo 3DS game console. My goal was to bring this milestone in the development of computer and console games a bit into the modern era, while maintaining the character and simplicity of this iconic 8-bit game and still using specific features of the 3DS console such as 3D screen, two displays, a faster CPU or the touch function. Even though diving through a star field is by no means realistic, it achieved a wonderful 3d effect on the Atari and this still works on the 3DS. Therefore, this unrealistic effect has been preserved. It should feel like you are playing the game on an Atari 400 home computer, but it should be as much fun as a real 3DS game.", "screenshots": [{"description": "Gameplay 1", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/gameplay-1.gif"}, {"description": "Gameplay 2", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/gameplay-2.gif"}, {"description": "Gameplay 3", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/gameplay-3.gif"}, {"description": "Title screen", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/title-screen.gif"}], "slug": "starcruiser7", "source": "https://github.com/dotMizi/StarCruiser7", "stars": 3, "systems": ["3DS"], "title": "StarCruiser7", "update_notes": "<p dir=\"auto\">The game is finally fun to play with these performance improvements</p>", "update_notes_md": "The game is finally fun to play with these performance improvements", "updated": "2024-12-06T15:57:52Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/starcruiser7"], "version": "v1.0.0", "version_title": "🤶🏿 🎄 X-mas release 🎄🤶🏿", "website": "https://gbatemp.net/threads/starcruiser7.620148/"}, {"archive": {"Pocket-NLSE.*\\.zip": {"Pocket-NLSE.3dsx": ["Pocket-NLSE/Pocket-NLSE.3dsx"], "Pocket-NLSE.cia": ["Pocket-NLSE/Pocket-NLSE.cia"]}}, "author": "Nat Osaka", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/704081?v=4", "categories": ["utility", "save-tool"], "color": "#007600", "color_bg": "#007600", "created": "2016-08-31T14:42:55Z", "description": "A portable save editor for Animal Crossing: New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS", "download_page": "https://github.com/dragos240/Pocket-NLSE/releases", "downloads": {"Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip": {"size": 2068489, "size_str": "1 MiB", "url": "https://github.com/dragos240/Pocket-NLSE/releases/download/v1.0.0/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip"}}, "github": "dragos240/Pocket-NLSE", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragos240/Pocket-NLSE/master/icon.png", "icon_index": 233, "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragos240/Pocket-NLSE/master/res/banner%20icon.png", "image_length": 5235, "license": "gpl-3.0", "license_name": "GNU General Public License v3.0", "slug": "pocket-nlse", "source": "https://github.com/dragos240/Pocket-NLSE", "stars": 16, "systems": ["3DS"], "title": "Pocket-NLSE", "unique_ids": [839214], "update_notes": "<p dir=\"auto\">First stable version of Pocket-NLSE.

Brog has at his disposal an arsenal of primitive weaponry ranging from Bone Bombs to Chinese Bottle Rockets and Heat Seeking Homing Pigeons.\n\nCMR was released in 2000 by Pangea Software as a Mac exclusive, and it was a pack-in game on Macs that came out around that time.\n\n## Nintendo 3DS Controls\n* D-Pad: navigate menus\n* A: forward\n* B: reverse\n* X: look behind\n* Y: brake\n* L-Shoulder: throw backwards\n* R-Shoulder: throw forwards\n* Select: change camera\n* Start: pause\n\n## About this port\n\nThis is a port of the original OS 9 version of the game.

It is an \"enhanced\" version insofar as it fixes bugs that may hinder the experience, and it brings in a few new features in keeping with the spirit of the original game.\n\n### Legal info\n\nCro-Mag Rally © 2000 Pangea Software, Inc.

To Use\n\nYou need to have the latest luma for this to work correctly.\n\n* Download `rehidhelper.3dsx` from the latest release\n* Open homebrew launcher and run the 3dsx\n* Click `A` on the `Download Rehid` option\n* Restart your 3ds\n* Go to https://mikahjc.github.io/3dsRemapBuilder/config and generate your remappings.\n* Run rehidhelper again and select the Scan QR code option\n* Scan your QR.\n\n## How To Remap Buttons\n\nYou first need to create a `rehid.json` file with the remappings you want. For eg:-\n```Json\n{\n    \"keys\":[\n        {\"get\":\"R\", \"press\":\"ZR\"},\n        {\"get\":\"L\", \"press\":\"ZL\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\nWith the above, everytime you press `ZR` key, `R` key would be triggered, \n\nand everytime you press `ZL` key, `L` key would be triggered.\n\nIt is also possible to do custom key combos, i.e.,\n```Json\n{\n    \"keys\":[\n        {\"get\":\"R\", \"press\":\"X+Y\"},\n        {\"get\":\"L+R\", \"press\":\"SELECT\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\nNow everytime you press `X+Y`, `R` key would be triggered and on pressing `SELECT` button, both `L` and `R` would be triggered.\n\nPossible Keys are:- \n`A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `SELECT`, `START`, `ZL`, `ZR`, `L`, `R`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `CRIGHT`(CPAD), `CLEFT`(CPAD), `CUP`(CPAD), `CDOWN`(CPAD)\n\nCopy your `rehid.json` file to the `rehid` folder.\n\n### Per Title Button Remapping\n\nIt is possible to have different button remapings for different titles:-\n\nInside the `rehid` folder, create a folder with the titleid as the folder name.\n\nYou can use [this](https://hax0kartik.github.io/3dsdb/) to fidn the titleid for your game.\n\nCopy the `rehid.json` file inside this folder.\n\n## Compilation\nGet devkitpro, ctrulib and makerom and then `make -j` to compile.\n\n## Credits\n\n@luigoalma Help, testing and listening to my rants.\n\nDruivensap on my discord server for helping me test out.\n\nLuma3ds devs and contributors", "qr": {"rehidhelper.cia": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/rehidhelper-cia.png"}, "screenshots": [{"description": "Helper", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/rehid/helper.png"}], "scripts": {"rehidhelper.cia": [{"directory": "/luma/titles/0004013000001D02", "type": "rmdir"}, {"directory": "/luma/titles/0004013000003302", "type": "rmdir"}, {"file": "rehidhelper.cia", "output": "/rehidhelper.cia", "repo": "hax0kartik/rehid", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/rehidhelper.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/rehidhelper.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}]}, "slug": "rehid", "source": "https://github.com/hax0kartik/rehid", "stars": 132, "systems": ["3DS"], "title": "rehid", "update_notes": "<p dir=\"auto\">This is the fifth public release of rehid.<br>\nThe following changes have been made:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Add debugpad support.</li>\n<li>Fix bugs in CPAD&gt;DPAD and DPAD&gt;CPAD remappings.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug where global remaps would <em>not</em> be applied on the home menu after you close a title.</li>\n<li>Rehidhelper has been rewritten and should be more stable.</li>\n<li>Rehidhelper is now available as a CIA and can be installed on the home screen directly.</li>\n<li>Add experimental support for turbofire/autofire.

version. As you may notice right away, we are changing our version numbering schema, but that’s not all! We are also planning on more frequent releases!, which you can read about on [sev’s blog](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-milestone-in-149535385).\n\nThis could be the biggest release we have made so far in terms of the added features and engines. If I count correctly, we have added 12 new engines to our compatibility page. Not games, engines. In terms of games, it is challenging to count, since two of the engines, SLUDGE and WAGE are authoring tools, but if you count games in our detection tables, that adds up to at least 194 titles!\n\nAnd there is so much more...\n\n# Changelog\n\n## New games:\n   - Added support for Dark Seed.\n   - Added support for God of Thunder.\n   - Added support for The Adventures of Willy Beamish.\n   - Added support for Heart of China.\n   - Added support for Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand.\n   - Added support for Nancy Drew: Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake.\n   - Added support for Ripley's Believe It or Not!: The Riddle of Master Lu.\n   - Added support for Little Longnose.\n   - Added support for Pilot Brothers 3: Back Side of the Earth.\n   - Added support for Pilot Brothers 3D.
