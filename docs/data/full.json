Art现在使用备用缓冲区并关闭光标\n* CPyMO ASCII Art现在可以运行时动态改变终端大小\n* 使用`cpymo-tool strip`取代`pymo-strip.ps1`\n* 使用`cpymo-tool convert`取代`pymo-convert.ps1`和`pymo-convert-audio.ps1`\n* `cpymo-tool gen-album-cache`现在可以自动搜索`#album`命令，不再需要手动传入列表名称\n\n# Bug 修正\n\n* 修正了在对话点击后没有刷新屏幕的问题\n* 修正在定义了`GAME_SELECTOR_DIR_2`时，只能显示其中一个文件夹的游戏的Bug\n* 修正在`ENABLE_SCREEN_FORCE_CENTERED`状态中依然会在SDL2后端下设置逻辑渲染大小的Bug\n* PSV在O3优化下会出现奇怪的行为，因此修改为O2优化级别\n* 修正背景效果层与Fade层的绘制顺序存在错误\n* 修正album界面在显示CG时退出会导致的内存泄漏\n* 修正在album中单张CG加载异常时产生的未定义行为\n* 修正在music和album中找不到列表文件的情况下产生的segmentation fault\n* change命令在加载脚本失败时触发segmentation fault\n* mo2pymo中对mo2的`GOTO_ENDING`命令解释有误\n* 秋之回忆2不能在结局部分正常跳回主界面的问题\n* 修复`namealign`字段不能被正确解释的问题\n* `cpymo-tool gen-album-ui`现在已经不会再覆盖已有的图像文件\n\n# 优化\n\n* 现在允许对内存分配进行剪裁，当以下情况不能获取足够内存时，将会进行内存剪裁并重试：\n    - 加载背景时\n    - 加载立绘时\n    - 关键字符串无法创建\n    - 需要播放BGM时\n    - 使用scroll命令时\n \n* 当使用BG_FADE或背景淡化时间为0时，则以低内存的方式加载背景后重试\n* 当进入album界面时，将会卸载背景图以降低内存占用\n* 更好用的文本提取API `cpymo_engine_extract_text`\n* 现在允许在确定取消对话框中响应取消操作\n* 改进头文件的导入方式，现在不需要再配置`-I`选项手动指定各种头文件了\n* 优化右键菜单背景的缩放比例，使得右键菜单文字一般不会溢出到背景之外\n", "updated": "2023-08-14T15:24:56Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/cpymo"], "version":

[Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/) version, then go into the folder corresponding to your console and download the .ips file. \nPut this file into your SD card in the following folder : `/luma/sysmodules/` then ensure you have \"Enable loading external FIRMs and modules\" and \"Enable game patching\" enabled in the Luma3DS settings (hold SELECT on boot)\n- Wii U : (not yet implemented)\n- Switch : (not yet implemented)\n### Note for 3DS users\nThe patch will do nothing if wumiibo is enabled, ensure wumiibo is disabled before attempting to scan any Amiibo or NFC tag\n# Why ?\nWhen writing an Amiibo to a blank Ntag215 NFC tag with an app such as [TagMo](https://github.com/HiddenRamblings/TagMo), the tag will become read-only on some parts of the data.\n\nThis data includes the Amiibo game character id, variant, figure type, model number and series.\n\nThis means that if it's read-only, you cannot change the figure stored on the NFC tag, which therefore mean having to buy multiple tags for every Amiibo you want.\n# Can't I just use Wumiibo/re_nfpii ?\nWell yes but sometimes games won't like when you open their menu and give you intense lag until you restart it, making those amiibo emulation apps unusable on those games.\n\nMoreover, this solution will give you the possibility to have physical tags, so you get the original experience with a few more features + you can easily share it with others as long as they have the patch too\n# What does this do ?\nThis modifies the NFC system module to disable the checks that are made on those areas, yes the console checks if the tag is read-only.\n\nBy disabling these checks, this means you can have write-enabled tags and they would still work on consoles with the patch installed\n\nAnd thus, you can reuse your tag forever without being constrained to have it as one specific Amiibo (you still have to rewrite it every time you want to change it)\n# Technical details\nSee the [GitHub

Just add your extra asset packs to the assets subdirectory in your TheXTech folder, and switch by holding select at the main menu.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Beta 4P support.</strong> Ever wanted to play Battle Mode with 3 of your best frenemies?

We worked long and hard on this update, however, we still need additional testing before we can release a stable version. This update will be the biggest in TheXTech's history and features a huge set of features, bugfixes, and improvements.\n\n# Most important changes\n\n* **Widescreen and small-screen support, done right.** No hacks, no editing `luna.lua`, no broken spawns. Play all of your favorite SMBX 1.3 content at your device's native resolution for a smooth and polished \"remaster\" experience, while the engine keeps track of which important items would have been onscreen (or offscreen!) in SMBX 1.3.\n\n* **Classic playstyle for classic content.** Disable TheXTech's unnecessary bugfixes and new features to play your SMBX 1.3 content the way its authors intended it, or go totally Vanilla (at your own risk).\n\n* **An options overhaul.** No more editing `thextech.ini`, every single game setting can be changed in the new in-game options menu.\n\n* **Refined player select.** A huge thank you to Savby for reimagining our text-based player select menus with an intuitive and colorful interface that feels right at home on your TV.\n\n* **Multiple asset packs.** TheXTech is good for more than just SMBX, and now you can conveniently switch between asset packs within the engine itself. Just add your extra asset packs to the assets subdirectory in your TheXTech folder, and switch by holding select at the main menu.\n\n* **Beta 4P support.** Ever wanted to play Battle Mode with 3 of your best frenemies? Now you can! This version introduces shared and split screen 4-player co-op and split screen 4-player battle.

Since the app fetches the latest version and configuration from its github repo, it can be adjusted or disabled remotely if a new version of B9S is released again or compatibility is lost. As the app does exactly the same steps as the 3DS hacking guide, it's perfectly safe to use.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Install the EzB9SUpdater cia or scan the QR code above.\n1. Launch the EzB9SUpdater app from the Home Menu.\n1. Follow the instructions in the app. At some point, you will be asked to press and hold the START button to reboot into SafeB9SInstaller.

It is a Star Raiders-like remake for the Nintendo 3DS game console. My goal was to bring this milestone in the development of computer and console games a bit into the modern era, while maintaining the character and simplicity of this iconic 8-bit game and still using specific features of the 3DS console such as 3D screen, two displays, a faster CPU or the touch function. Even though diving through a star field is by no means realistic, it achieved a wonderful 3d effect on the Atari and this still works on the 3DS. Therefore, this unrealistic effect has been preserved. It should feel like you are playing the game on an Atari 400 home computer, but it should be as much fun as a real 3DS game.", "screenshots": [{"description": "Gameplay 1", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/gameplay-1.gif"}, {"description": "Gameplay 2", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/gameplay-2.gif"}, {"description": "Gameplay 3", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/gameplay-3.gif"}, {"description": "Title screen", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/starcruiser7/title-screen.gif"}], "slug": "starcruiser7", "source": "https://github.com/dotMizi/StarCruiser7", "stars": 3, "systems": ["3DS"], "title": "StarCruiser7", "update_notes": "<p dir=\"auto\">The game is finally fun to play with these performance improvements</p>", "update_notes_md": "The game is finally fun to play with these performance improvements", "updated": "2024-12-06T15:57:52Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/starcruiser7"], "version": "v1.0.0", "version_title": "🤶🏿 🎄 X-mas release 🎄🤶🏿", "website": "https://gbatemp.net/threads/starcruiser7.620148/"}, {"archive": {"bottomless-block-barrage.zip": {"bottomless-block-barrage.3dsx": ["3ds/bottomless-block-barrage/bottomless-block-barrage.3dsx"]}}, "author": "Brandon", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/824564?v=4", "categories": ["game"], "color": "#8b8c8b", "color_bg": "#7f807f", "created": "2016-03-04T08:01:22Z", "description": "Panel de Pon (Tetris Attack) clone for the 3ds.", "download_page": "https://github.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/releases", "downloads": {"bottomless-block-barrage.cia": {"size": 1369024, "size_str": "1 MiB", "url": "https://github.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/releases/download/v0.2.0/bottomless-block-barrage.cia"}, "bottomless-block-barrage.zip": {"size": 710782, "size_str": "694 KiB", "url": "https://github.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/releases/download/v0.2.0/bottomless-block-barrage.zip"}}, "github": "TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/master/resources/icon.png", "icon_index": 118, "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/master/resources/banner.png", "image_length": 42720, "license": "gpl-3.0", "license_name": "GNU General Public License v3.0", "qr": {"bottomless-block-barrage.cia": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/bottomless-block-barrage-cia.png"}, "screenshots": [{"description": "Config", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/bottomless-block-barrage/config.png"}, {"description": "Endless", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/bottomless-block-barrage/endless.png"}, {"description": "Score", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/bottomless-block-barrage/score.png"}, {"description": "Title", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/bottomless-block-barrage/title.png"}], "slug": "bottomless-block-barrage", "source": "https://github.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage", "stars": 19, "systems": ["3DS"], "title": "Bottomless Block Barrage", "unique_ids": [723739], "update_notes": "<h2 dir=\"auto\">Whats new</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Goal Marker in Score mode type lines.<br>\nUpdated replay file format and made replays better.<br>\nSupport for more skill chain techniques.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The engine is now more timed like the original games.<br>\nIn endless mode you level up now with the number of panels removed.<br>\nTimeout values are now more based on the original.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Known Issues</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Issue <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"249974535\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/issues/10\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/issues/10/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/TricksterGuy/bottomless-block-barrage/issues/10\">#10</a>.

It is a fun, retro Mario Kart-style racing game.\n\n## About Cro-Mag Rally\n\nIn Cro-Mag Rally you are a speed-hungry caveman named Brog who races through the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages in primitive vehicles such as the Geode Cruiser, Bone Buggy, Logmobile, Trojan Horse, and many others. Brog has at his disposal an arsenal of primitive weaponry ranging from Bone Bombs to Chinese Bottle Rockets and Heat Seeking Homing Pigeons.\n\nCMR was released in 2000 by Pangea Software as a Mac exclusive, and it was a pack-in game on Macs that came out around that time.\n\n## Nintendo 3DS Controls\n* D-Pad: navigate menus\n* A: forward\n* B: reverse\n* X: look behind\n* Y: brake\n* L-Shoulder: throw backwards\n* R-Shoulder: throw forwards\n* Select: change camera\n* Start: pause\n\n## About this port\n\nThis is a port of the original OS 9 version of the game. It aims to provide the best way to experience CMR on today’s computers. It is an \"enhanced\" version insofar as it fixes bugs that may hinder the experience, and it brings in a few new features in keeping with the spirit of the original game.\n\n### Legal info\n\nCro-Mag Rally © 2000 Pangea Software, Inc.

See how I feel these characters rate in 5 absolutely subjective qualities.\n\nDoes it fall under fair use? Who knows? But I don't think I'm causing much damage to a thirteen year old series on a sub-240p display, even if there are two of them.\n\nThe game is provided as a .nds file, suitable for a flashcart, modded 3DS, or emulator of your choice.\n\nTragically, there is no sound. Anyone who can help with that probably has better things to do.\n\nBuilt with NightFoxLib (which feeds off of DevKitPro, LibNDS). Code was written in C++ in Notepad. Python was used to test some logic, and to process pictures from Krita.\n\nBasic rules are: You pick one of five qualities listed on your card. If your value is bigger than your opponent's you win their card, and both cards go to the bottom of your deck. Lose, and it's your opponent's turn. They play by the same rules, and the game ends when one player has no more cards.

For eg:-\n```Json\n{\n    \"keys\":[\n        {\"get\":\"R\", \"press\":\"ZR\"},\n        {\"get\":\"L\", \"press\":\"ZL\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\nWith the above, everytime you press `ZR` key, `R` key would be triggered, \n\nand everytime you press `ZL` key, `L` key would be triggered.\n\nIt is also possible to do custom key combos, i.e.,\n```Json\n{\n    \"keys\":[\n        {\"get\":\"R\", \"press\":\"X+Y\"},\n        {\"get\":\"L+R\", \"press\":\"SELECT\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\nNow everytime you press `X+Y`, `R` key would be triggered and on pressing `SELECT` button, both `L` and `R` would be triggered.\n\nPossible Keys are:- \n`A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `SELECT`, `START`, `ZL`, `ZR`, `L`, `R`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `CRIGHT`(CPAD), `CLEFT`(CPAD), `CUP`(CPAD), `CDOWN`(CPAD)\n\nCopy your `rehid.json` file to the `rehid` folder.\n\n### Per Title Button Remapping\n\nIt is possible to have different button remapings for different titles:-\n\nInside the `rehid` folder, create a folder with the titleid as the folder name.\n\nYou can use [this](https://hax0kartik.github.io/3dsdb/) to fidn the titleid for your game.\n\nCopy the `rehid.json` file inside this folder.\n\n## Compilation\nGet devkitpro, ctrulib and makerom and then `make -j` to compile.\n\n## Credits\n\n@luigoalma Help, testing and listening to my rants.\n\nDruivensap on my discord server for helping me test out.\n\nLuma3ds devs and contributors", "qr": {"rehidhelper.cia": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/rehidhelper-cia.png"}, "screenshots": [{"description": "Helper", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/rehid/helper.png"}], "scripts": {"rehidhelper.cia": [{"directory": "/luma/titles/0004013000001D02", "type": "rmdir"}, {"directory": "/luma/titles/0004013000003302", "type": "rmdir"}, {"file": "rehidhelper.cia", "output": "/rehidhelper.cia", "repo": "hax0kartik/rehid", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/rehidhelper.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/rehidhelper.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}]}, "slug": "rehid", "source": "https://github.com/hax0kartik/rehid", "stars": 106, "systems": ["3DS"], "title": "rehid", "update_notes": "<p dir=\"auto\">This is the fifth public release of rehid.<br>\nThe following changes have been made:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Add debugpad support.</li>\n<li>Fix bugs in CPAD&gt;DPAD and DPAD&gt;CPAD remappings.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug where global remaps would <em>not</em> be applied on the home menu after you close a title.</li>\n<li>Rehidhelper has been rewritten and should be more stable.</li>\n<li>Rehidhelper is now available as a CIA and can be installed on the home screen directly.</li>\n<li>Add experimental support for turbofire/autofire.

Uxn is a portable 8-bit virtual computer inspired by [forth-machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)), capable of running simple tools and games programmable in its own [assembly language](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html).\n\nThis emulator allows you run to your uxn projects on the 3DS, it can also be used for developers who want to learn how to program little 8-bit things.\n\nIt was designed with an implementation-first mindset with a focus on creating portable graphical applications, the distribution of Uxn projects is akin to sharing game roms for any classic console emulator.\n\n### Usage\nBy default, uxnds will run /uxn/boot.rom or /uxn/launcher.rom. It also supports reading files from within /uxn.\n\nOn start, a keyboard is presented on the bottom screen, and the uxn display - on the top screen. Use the L or R buttons to swap them - in this configuration, mouse input is approximated via touchscreen.\n\nYou can use the system button in the lower-left corner to reset the uxn virtual machine.\n\n### Installation\nTwo ports are provided: the 3DS port (compatible with 3DS consoles) and the NDS port (compatible with DS, DSi and 3DS consoles).\n\n#### 3DS port\nThere is one binary provided: uxnds.3dsx.\n\n#### NDS port\nWhen using a real DS, DSi or 3DS console, it is recommended to launch this program via [nds-hb-menu](https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-hb-menu) - though, as it currently doesn't use argc/argv, it doesn't really change much.\n\nThere are three binaries provided:\n- uxnds.nds - faster, but best used only with known-good software,\n- uxnds_debug.nds - slower, but provides debugging information, profiling information and performs CPU stack bounds checks.\n- uxnds_profile.nds - almost as fast as uxnds.nds - with debugging/profiling information, no CPU stack bounds checks.\n", "scripts": {"uxnds.3dsx": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/uxnds.3dsx", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_debug.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_debug.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_debug.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_profile.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_profile.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_profile.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}]}, "slug": "uxnds", "source": "https://github.com/asiekierka/uxnds", "stars": 151, "systems": ["3DS", "DS"], "title": "uxnds", "update_notes": "<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>[NDS] Updated to BlocksDS 1.3.1.</li>\n</ul>", "update_notes_md": "* [NDS] Updated to BlocksDS 1.3.1.", "updated": "2024-07-26T18:11:33Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/uxnds", "https://db.universal-team.net/ds/uxnds"], "version": "v0.5.2", "version_title": "uxnds 0.5.2", "website": "https://100r.co/site/uxn.html", "wiki": "https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html"}, {"archive": {"HoriHD-Gallery.7z": {"HoriHD-Gallery.3dsx": ["HoriHD-Gallery.3dsx"], "HoriHD-Gallery.cia": ["HoriHD-Gallery.cia"]}}, "author": "RocketRobz", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16110127?v=4", "categories": ["utility"], "color": "#5f5f5f", "color_bg": "#5f5f5f", "created": "2017-08-04T22:17:54Z", "description": "A demonstration of the 800px mode on 3DS consoles.", "download_page": "https://github.com/RocketRobz/HoriHD-Gallery/releases", "downloads": {"HoriHD-Gallery.7z": {"size": 36652357, "size_str": "34 MiB", "url": "https://github.com/RocketRobz/HoriHD-Gallery/releases/download/v1.0.2/HoriHD-Gallery.7z"}}, "github": "RocketRobz/HoriHD-Gallery", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketRobz/HoriHD-Gallery/master/app/icon.png", "icon_index": 214, "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketRobz/HoriHD-Gallery/master/app/banner.png", "image_length": 10610, "long_description": "A demonstration of the 800px mode on 3DS consoles.

"license": "mit", "license_name": "MIT License", "long_description": "# 3D Pinball - Space Cadet for 3DS\n\nThis is a port of 3D Pinball - Space Cadet for Nintendo 3DS. It's originally a game that came bundled with Windows from Windows 95 up to Windows XP. This is the current state of the project:\n\n- No menus, options, or results screen.\n- It plays sound effects and music (if the player supplies the music in OGG format).\n- There are still some bugs here and there.\n- It should be running fine on New 3DS, but on a regular 3DS it runs slow.\n\nIt is based on the PC decompilation made by [k4zmu2a](https://github.com/k4zmu2a): https://github.com/k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball\n\nThe PC decompilation uses SDL2 to render the game. This 3DS port has been changed to use native GPU rendering with the Citro3D library.\n\n## How to build\n\nThe main requirement is to have [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org).\n\nFollow the instructions to install devkitPro here: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started\nYou will also need the 3DS development package, and also the libraries 3ds-sdl and 3ds-sdl_mixer.\n\nIf you use Windows or Ubuntu, here are more detailed instructions.\n\n### Windows\n\nEven though devkitPro offers a Windows installer, I've had some issues setting it up. It's easier to use WSL. If you want to use the Windows installer anyway, check the link above for instructions.\n\n1. Install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). By default it will install Ubuntu, which is fine.\n2. Open a WSL terminal and just follow the Ubuntu instructions below. With the difference that, if you want to clone the project into, for example, the `C:\\` folder, you will need move to that folder inside the terminal with the command `cd /mnt/c/`.\n\n### Ubuntu and other Debian based linux distros\n\n1. Open the terminal in the folder where you want to clone the project.\n2. Clone it with the command `git clone --branch 3ds https://github.com/MaikelChan/SpaceCadetPinball`. A subfolder called `SpaceCadetPinball` will be created containing the project.\n3. Move to that subfolder with `cd SpaceCadetPinball`.\n4. Download the latest version of the [custom devkitPro pacman](https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases/tag/v1.0.2), that will be used to download the compilers and libraries to build the project. Once downloaded, put it in the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder.\n5. Install devkitPro pacman with this command: `sudo gdebi devkitpro-pacman.amd64.deb`. If gdebi is not found, install it with `sudo apt install gdebi-core`, and then try again installing pacman.\n6. Use the following command to sync pacman databases: `sudo dkp-pacman -Sy`.\n7. Now update packages with `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu`.\n8. Install the 3DS development tools with `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev`.\n9. Install SDL with `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-sdl`.\n10. Install SDL_mixer with `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-sdl_mixer`.\n11. Set the DEVKITPRO environment variables so the system knows where the compilers and libraries are installed with these commands:\n    - `export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro`.\n    - `export DEVKITARM=/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM`.\n12. To generate Build the project with the command `make -j4`.\n13. Optionally, to generate a CIA file, you will need to have [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases/) and [makerom](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases) in the `$DEVKITPRO/tools/bin` folder. Then build the project with the command `make -j4 BUILD_CIA=1`.\n\nAfter a successful build, you will get a file called `SpaceCadetPinball.3dsx`, which is the main executable.\n\n## How to run\n\n### 3DS with Homebrew Launcher\n\n1. Go to your SD card and enter the `3ds` folder.\n2. Copy `SpaceCadetPinbal.3dsx` into the `3ds` folder.\n3. Make sure you have your `dspfirm.cdc` in the `3ds` folder, as you will need it to have sound in homebrew games. If you don't have it, [dump your DSP](https://github.com/zoogie/DSP1/releases/latest).\n4. Inside the `3ds` folder, create a new folder named `SpaceCadetPinball`.\n5. For legal reasons, you will need to get the original PC game on your own to obtain the assets like graphics and sound effects. Those are not contained in this repository.\n6. Copy all files from the original PC version into the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder that was created earlier.\n7. Optionally, since this port doesn't play MIDI files, you'll need to convert the music to ogg format, and call the file `PINBALL.ogg`, and put it along the other assets in the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder. Make sure that the music has a sample rate no higher than 44100Hz, or it won't play correctly.\n8. If everything went fine, you should be able to run the game from the Homebrew Launcher.\n\n### Citra\n\n1. Get the [Citra emulator](https://citra-emu.org/download/) if you don't have it.\n2. Open it and go to the menu `File/Open Citra Folder`. This will open the folder where Citra's configuration is stored.\n3. Go to the `sdmc` folder and create a new folder there named `3ds` if it doesn't exist already.\n4. Enter the `3ds` folder and create an empty file there named `dspfirm.cdc`. This will allow to have audio in homebrew apps.\n5. Inside the `3ds` folder create another folder named `SpaceCadetPinball`.\n6. For legal reasons, you will need to get the original PC game on your own to obtain the assets like graphics and sound effects. Those are not contained in this repository.\n7. Copy all PC game's assets to the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder that was created earlier.\n8. Optionally, since this port doesn't play MIDI files, you'll need to convert the music to ogg format, and call the file `PINBALL.ogg`, and put it along the other assets in the `SpaceCadetPinball` folder. Make sure that the music has a sample rate no higher than 44100Hz, or it won't play correctly.\n9. If everything went fine, you should be able to run the game.\n\n## How to play\n\n| Button               | Action

Master the art of the cook on your Nintendo DS system and prepare the perfect batch&mdash;lest you meet the wrong end of Gus. Hone your cook in both Singleplayer and Local Multiplayer Vs.\n\n## Instructions\n### Tutorial (1P)\nThe Tutorial will teach you how to play! Gale will provide instructions on how to complete each Minigame. To access the Tutorial, select it from the Main Menu.\n\n### Story Mode (1P)\nTo start story mode, start the game. Touch to start, then tap \"Start Game → Story Mode.\"\n\nGus has appointed you Head Cook! Meet his ever-increasing demands by cooking against the clock in the Superlab. Each day, you'll be given a Quota you must complete within a set time limit to progress on to the next day. After each day, you'll receive your pay packet based on your performance and efficiency, which you can spend in Saul's shop!\n\nStory mode lasts five days, and there are two possible endings (\"Good\" and \"Bad\"). Good luck!\n\n### Local Multiplayer (2P)\nBreaking Bad for Nintendo DS also supports up to two Nintendo DS systems playing together in a Multiplayer Vs. Battle to see who can complete their batches the quickest. To set this up:\n\n* On the first system, launch the game. Touch to start, then tap \"Start Game → Host.\"\n* On the second system, launch the game, touch to start, then tap \"Start Game → Join.\"\n* Wait for the systems to establish communications.\n* On the Host console, press the A Button to start the game.\n\nThe Host system will play as Walter, while the guest will play as Jesse. The magic that makes it work is thanks to the incredible [Fewnity](https://github.com/Fewnity/Nintendo-DS-Nifi-Template/)'s amazing NiFi scaffold!\n\n### Hank's Minerals\nBy completing certain challenges, you'll find minerals! Hank will appraise minerals you find in the \"Hank's Minerals\" submenu, located in the Extras Menu. There are twelve minerals to find, and you can view how to get them by tapping on each `[?]` icon in the menu.\n\nOnce you've obtained a mineral, it will be displayed in the menu and selecting it will tell you what it is. Minerals marked with \"??????\" are a secret, so no hints there!\n\n### Music Player\nYou can listen to the game music through the Music Player submenu, located in the Extras menu. Use the left and right buttons on the + Control Pad to change the track.", "nightly": {"download_page": "https://github.com/WiIIiam278/breaking-bad-ds/actions", "downloads": {"Breaking Bad DS.zip": {"url": "https://nightly.link/WiIIiam278/breaking-bad-ds/workflows/ci/main/Breaking%20Bad%20DS.zip"}}}, "qr": {"breaking-bad-ds.nds": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/breaking-bad-ds-nds.png"}, "screenshots": [{"description": "Hanks minerals", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/hanks-minerals.png"}, {"description": "In the lab", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/in-the-lab.png"}, {"description": "Minigame", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/minigame.png"}, {"description": "Multiplayer vs", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/multiplayer-vs.png"}, {"description": "Story mode", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/story-mode.png"}, {"description": "Title screen", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/breaking-bad-ds/title-screen.png"}], "slug": "breaking-bad-ds", "source": "https://github.com/WiIIiam278/breaking-bad-ds", "stars": 126, "systems": ["DS"], "title": "Breaking Bad DS", "update_notes": "<h2 dir=\"auto\">Change notes</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Updated dialogue with Gus and Gale\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Fixed a few spelling mistakes (addage -&gt; adage, apologise -&gt; apologize)</li>\n<li>Fixed Gale's introductory text implying you have already turned the ventilation valve</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed save data sometimes not correctly tracking the state of the game</li>\n<li>Improved the stability of the game ending logic\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Added a failsafe dialogue state check before end-of-day dialogue on Day 5</li>\n<li>The game will now forcibly defrag the VRAM sprite buffers before displaying the End Screen</li>\n<li>The game will now award the \"Completed Story Mode\" mineral achievement before displaying the End Screen</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where the mineral selection sound effect on Hank's Minerals screen would play multiple times, would still play if a mineral was not selected, and would also still play if the same mineral was selected</li>\n<li>Added sound effects to the \"cracking\" minigame; the \"pestle hit\" effect will now also play when a critical hit/golden hammer hit is landed on a section or crystal of methamphetamine product</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Playing</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For the absolute best experience, pop the ROM on a flashcart and enjoy!</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">On an Emulator</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">But if you're not as bothered as Walter is about doing things with the proper gear, <a href=\"https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS/releases/latest\">melonDS</a> is the recommended emulator for play due to its accuracy and performance.

Version 1.5.1 fixes this bug.\n\nQR code for CIA:\n\n![https://github.com/flarn2006/GraphCalc3DS/releases/download/v1.5.1/GraphCalc3DS.cia](http://i.imgur.com/qzu5DL3.png)\n", "updated": "2016-12-03T21:05:23Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/graphcalc3ds"], "version": "v1.5.1", "version_title": "Version 1.5.1"}, {"author": "Zachary-Rude", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84681078?v=4", "categories": ["game"], "color": "#20de00", "color_bg": "#128000", "created": "2023-10-09T14:21:52Z", "description": "A basic Snake clone for 3DS", "download_page": "https://github.com/Zachary-Rude/Snake-for-3DS/releases", "downloads": {"snake.3dsx": {"size": 148172, "size_str": "144 KiB", "url": "https://github.com/Zachary-Rude/Snake-for-3DS/releases/download/v1.3/snake.3dsx"}, "snake.cia": {"size": 698816, "size_str": "682 KiB", "url": "https://github.com/Zachary-Rude/Snake-for-3DS/releases/download/v1.3/snake.cia"}}, "github": "Zachary-Rude/Snake-for-3DS", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zachary-Rude/Snake-for-3DS/master/icon.png", "icon_index": 257, "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zachary-Rude/Snake-for-3DS/master/banner.png", "image_length": 2179, "license": "mit", "license_name": "MIT License", "long_description": "A simple 3DS version of the classic Snake.\n\nYou start moving faster as you get more points.", "qr": {"snake.cia": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/qr/snake-cia.png"}, "slug": "snake-for-3ds", "source": "https://github.com/Zachary-Rude/Snake-for-3DS", "stars": 0, "systems": ["3DS"], "title": "Snake for 3DS", "unique_ids": [272016], "update_notes": "<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Added pausing</li>\n<li>Added game over screen</li>\n<li>Text for high score is now displayed on the line below the score text</li>\n</ul>", "update_notes_md": "- Added pausing\n- Added game over screen\n- Text for high score is now displayed on the line below the score text", "updated": "2023-10-11T23:32:53Z", "urls": ["https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/snake-for-3ds"], "version": "v1.3", "version_title": "v1.3"}, {"author": "zoeyjodon", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76182954?v=4", "categories": ["utility"], "color": "#91959a", "color_bg": "#787b80", "created": "2023-10-17T20:37:53Z", "description": "Gamestream client for the New 3DS", "download_page": "https://github.com/zoeyjodon/moonlight-N3DS/releases", "downloads": {"moonlight.cia": {"size": 4076480, "size_str": "3 MiB", "url": "https://github.com/zoeyjodon/moonlight-N3DS/releases/download/v2.0.0/moonlight.cia"}}, "github": "zoeyjodon/moonlight-N3DS", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoeyjodon/moonlight-N3DS/n3ds-main/3ds/res/ic_moonlight.png", "icon_index": 258, "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoeyjodon/moonlight-N3DS/n3ds-main/3ds/res/banner.png", "image_length": 7154, "license": "gpl-3.0", "license_name": "GNU General Public License v3.0", "long_description": "Moonlight is an open source client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream for the New Nintendo 3DS, forked from Moonlight Embedded.
