update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V10.5: 14-Mar-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Update to the Z80 core to improve emulation accuracy. This emulator now passes
  the ZEXALL test suite.</li>

  <li>Added proper M1 wait states for the Colecovision, ADAM and MSX emulation for
  improved CPU handling.</li>

  <li>A few optimized Z80 lookup-tables brings in some additional speed for both the
  DSi and DS-Lite/Phat.</li>

  <li>Improved file loading so that it''s more robust - ensuring a higher level of
  consistency in loading large files into memory.</li>

  <li>Other minor cleanups as time permitted.</li>

  </ul>'
