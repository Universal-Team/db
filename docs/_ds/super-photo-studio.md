update_notes: '<p>It''s been a while since this homebrew application released. Unfortunately,
  I have not worked on this very often due to working on TWLMenu++ and nds-bootstrap.<br>

  Since I''ve implemented plenty of changes over the years in my spare time, I''ve
  decided to release a new version as maybe a way to show what''s coming in the future.
  Expect a few bugs to occur.</p>

  <p>With this release, it might be the largest DS(i) and/or 3DS homebrew app in existence.</p>

  <h3>What''s new?</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Renamed to <em>Super All-Star Photo Studio</em> to reflect the all-star cast
  of characters!</li>

  <li><strong>3DS:</strong> <em>Hori-HD</em> has been renamed to <em>Horizon HD</em>
  (named after Nintendo Switch''s Horizon OS)!</li>

  <li>Now runs on DS and DS Lite consoles!

  <ul>

  <li>When running from flashcards, a page file is used in order to fit 5 characters
  on screen like on DSi and 3DS consoles. It is recommended to use a Memory Expansion
  Pak to avoid having to use up write cycles on the microSD card.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>More music has been added! (Not much though.)

  <ul>

  <li>Last-selected music will play each time you start this application.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Grace (from <em>Style Savvy</em>) now has 30 poses!</li>

  <li>Updated outfits for Robz &amp; Rabz.</li>

  <li>NightScript has been added as a new character!</li>

  <li>Added support for custom characters! See <a href="https://github.com/RocketRobz/SuperAllStarPhotoStudio?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-custom-characters">this
  section</a> for how to add them.</li>

  </ul>'

Super Photo Studio is basically an upgraded version of the Style Savvy series's photo studio feature, with added characters and locations outside of said series. You can also change the character's expressions and poses, though Super Photo Studio does not support changing expressions.
