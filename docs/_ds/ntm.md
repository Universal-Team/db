  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Unlaunch is now <strong>required</strong> to use NTM

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>There have been two bricks because of NTM and I no longer feel comfortable recommending
  this tool without Unlaunch</li>

  <li>There are also now zero downsides to Unlaunch thanks to TWiLight Menu++''s new
  launcher patches that keep all the good patches while also keeping the splash screen
  and menu sounds</li>

  <li>I have pulled all previous releases, due to git history you can still build
  them if you need but please, for the love of all things good, do not distribute
  them under any circumstances</li>

NAND Title Manager, NTM for short, is an application for the Nintendo DSi that allows you to manage titles on your NAND. It can manage titles on both [hiyaCFW](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/hiyacfw/)'s SDNAND and your actual internal memory, typically called SysNAND. **When using in SysNAND mode please use with caution**.

Please see the [guide on the wiki](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/NTM/wiki/How-to-Install-DSiWare) for how to properly and safely use NTM.
