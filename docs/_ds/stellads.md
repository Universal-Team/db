update_notes: '<p dir="auto">8.0 : 09-Dec-2024 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added music fetchers for more complete Chetiry (CTY) emulation. Save state works
  with CTY. Use the 60K Chetiry rom for music.</li>

  <li>Fixed holding RESET (DS Start button) and SELECT (DS Select Button) when loading
  a game. This allows you to do things like the Double-Shot trick in Space Invaders.</li>
