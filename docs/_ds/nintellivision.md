update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V6.2 on 23-Dec-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>New 60Hz True-Sync technology to match DS LCD refresh with emulated frame output
  to provide for a largely tear-free display.</li>

  <li>New ''Favorites'' system to mark any game file as ''Like'' (yellow heart) or
  ''Love'' (red heart) - press SELECT on ROM select screen.</li>

  <li>CP1610 and related Video optimization to provide almost 5% speed-bost to help
  with older DS hardware emulation.</li>

  <li>Slide-n-Glide now available in D-PAD options on a per-game basis. Makes climbing
  ladders a bit easier in some games.</li>

  <li>Refactored highscore code to free up 64K of RAM for future use.</li>

  <li>Updated for newest custom overlays for latest homebrews.</li>
