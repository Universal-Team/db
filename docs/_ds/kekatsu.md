update_notes: '<h2 dir="auto">Changes</h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>The main SDK is now BlocksDS. Support for DevkitPro has been removed. Check
  the new instructions for building</li>

  <li>Added pagination for database list section, removing the limit of 8 databases</li>

  <li>Temporarily removed speed information from download screen since it was mostly
  inaccurate</li>

  <li>The file name <code class="notranslate">databases.txt.txt</code> is checked
  too other than <code class="notranslate">databases.txt</code> for loading the database
  list.<br>

  This has been done to handle the frequent mistake of creating a new text file as
  <code class="notranslate">databases.txt</code> and having it saved as <code class="notranslate">databases.txt.txt</code>
  by the OS</li>

  </ul>

*Kekatsu* is a straightforward content downloader for DS and DSi consoles.
The main feature of this app is the use of content databases to download apps and games on the fly for any platform.
### Key features
- Standalone
- Multi-platform content
- Custom databases
- Color scheme customization
- Localization support

An already available database to use with Kekatsu is [UDB-Kekatsu-DS](https://github.com/cavv-dev/UDB-Kekatsu-DS), which is an updated selection of DS and DSi apps from [Universal-DB](https://db.universal-team.net/).
Check out the [Databases setup](https://github.com/cavv-dev/Kekatsu-DS?tab=readme-ov-file#databases-setup) section for info on how to set it up.
