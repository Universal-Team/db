Unxds is a port of the [Unx virtual machine](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html) to the 3DS. Uxn is a portable 8-bit virtual computer inspired by [forth-machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)), capable of running simple tools and games programmable in its own [assembly language](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html).

This emulator allows you run to your uxn projects on the 3DS, it can also be used for developers who want to learn how to program little 8-bit things.

It was designed with an implementation-first mindset with a focus on creating portable graphical applications, the distribution of Uxn projects is akin to sharing game roms for any classic console emulator.

### Usage
By default, uxnds will run /uxn/boot.rom or /uxn/launcher.rom. It also supports reading files from within /uxn.

On start, a keyboard is presented on the bottom screen, and the uxn display - on the top screen. Use the L or R buttons to swap them - in this configuration, mouse input is approximated via touchscreen.

You can use the system button in the lower-left corner to reset the uxn virtual machine.

### Installation
Two ports are provided: the 3DS port (compatible with 3DS consoles) and the NDS port (compatible with DS, DSi and 3DS consoles).

#### 3DS port
There is one binary provided: uxnds.3dsx.

#### NDS port
When using a real DS, DSi or 3DS console, it is recommended to launch this program via [nds-hb-menu](https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-hb-menu) - though, as it currently doesn't use argc/argv, it doesn't really change much.

There are three binaries provided:
- uxnds.nds - faster, but best used only with known-good software,
- uxnds_debug.nds - slower, but provides debugging information, profiling information and performs CPU stack bounds checks.
- uxnds_profile.nds - almost as fast as uxnds.nds - with debugging/profiling information, no CPU stack bounds checks.
