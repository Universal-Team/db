update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Initial Release!</p>

  <p dir="auto">Each player takes turns rolling dice and flipping tiles that add up
  to the dice total. When a player can''t do this, their turn is over. The remaining
  tiles are added up and that becomes the player''s score. The player with the lowest
  score wins. If a player manages to get a score of 0, they have closed the box. The
  next player must then also close the box for gameplay to continue. If they fail
  to do so, the last player automatically wins.</p>'
