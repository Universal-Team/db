update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V3.8 : 02-Feb-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fixed banking so games like Dropzone properly render lower screen graphics (moonscape).</li>

  <li>Improved 64K banking for games that only sparingly swap banks - these can now
  use the faster CPU core driver (renders Dropzone and Laser Hawk full speed on older
  DS-Lite hardware)</li>

  <li>More CPU optimizations to improve speed slightly.</li>

  <li>More games are now running full speed on the DS-Lite - Vanguard is now playable!</li>

  <li>Latest hacks from the A5200 forums on Atariage have been added to the internal
  database.</li>

  </ul>'
