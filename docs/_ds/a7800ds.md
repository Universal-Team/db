description: Atari 7800 DS Emulator - updated from Alekmaul's original. Striving for
  accuracy and speed on the venerable DS handheld. Don't expect perfect emulation
  but things are good enough to enjoy Atari's last major 8-bit console.

update_notes: '<p dir="auto">V5.1 : 27-Feb-2025 by wavemotion-dave</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>7800 BIOS is now supported. Place bios exactly named ''7800.rom'' in /roms/bios,
  /data/bios or same directory as the emulator itself.</li>

  <li>New internal database with many cleanups and corrections. Now compliant with
  Trebor Pro-Pack v8_16 from early 2025.</li>

  <li>New configuration option to allow mapping both both X and Y buttons.</li>

  <li>Maria and CPU cycle counting are much closer to real hardware - all of the DMA
  Cycle adjustments/hacks have been removed.</li>

  <li>This fixes a number of small problems such as Pole Position II joystick selection
  of track when game loads.</li>
