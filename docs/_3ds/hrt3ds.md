update_notes: '<p dir="auto">At last v1.0.0 is ready! Now featuring:</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>6 Nightmare Horses (AMF, BIN, NGT, OOB, FF8, and FFF)</li>

  <li>Likewise, increased horse cap to 15 on map 1</li>

  <li>New map (map 4), supports 1 to 7 horses at once</li>

  <li>New custom background music, plus update to the old bg track</li>

  <li>Each horse now has their own respective win theme</li>

  <li>Updated Yellow''s name to Lightning Strikes Thrice</li>

  <li>Added a main menu</li>

  <li>Ability to set up custom races (choose horse lineup, map, and bg track)</li>

  <li>Huge code rewrite behind-the-scenes to allow for much better performance on
  both old and new 3ds models with many horses</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 dir="auto">Bugfixes:</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Game should load in slightly faster</li>

  <li>Wall-hit sfxs will no longer occasionally play twice per collision</li>

  <li>Horses clip through walls much less often than before on old 3ds models</li>

  <li>Properly rescaled Place Your Bets box should no longer take as long to load/update</li>

  <li>Overall performance should be much better in most regards, despite some new
  audio glitches on old 3ds</li>

  <li>Icon corners now properly blend into Homebrew Launcher menu</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">There are still some more features planned to be added later, but
  for now the game feels complete enough to call it the 1.0.0 release.</p>'
