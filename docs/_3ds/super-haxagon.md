update_notes: '<h1 dir="auto">Documentation Update</h1>

  <p dir="auto">This version is almost exactly the same as 3.9.0, except the downloads
  include two new files, outlined below. If you already have v3.9.0 and have installed
  it properly, there isn''t much need to update. (And if you don''t know what version
  you have, you should probably update!)</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">Changelog</h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>nspire: There are now at least two buttons to perform all basic actions, in
  case one of your keys is sticky.</li>

  <li>sdl2 and sfml: Drivers and downloads have been renamed to better show what back-end
  the driver is using.</li>

  <li>all: Downloads now have a <code class="notranslate">README.md</code> that gives
  offline instructions on how to set up your platform, as well as a link back to this
  repo.</li>

  <li>all: Downloads now have a <code class="notranslate">vX.X.X.txt</code> file that
  includes some metadata for the release, like which commit hash the download came
  from, version information, how it was built, and the time it was built.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2 dir="auto">Install</h2>

  <p dir="auto">Please see the <a href="https://github.com/RedTopper/Super-Haxagon/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>
  to install SuperHaxagon for your platform, or the <em>new</em> <code class="notranslate">README.md</code>
  within the .zip file itself!</p>
