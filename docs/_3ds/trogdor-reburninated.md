update_notes: '<h3>Before the update notes, an important message:</h3>

  <p><strong>This is probably the final update!</strong> I could keep adding new features
  and making minor tweaks forever, but I have to call it some day, and that day is
  today. I may make another update if a bug needs to be fixed, and I''m not ruling
  out the possibility of ports to additional systems (those would be added to this
  release after the fact), but consider <em>Trogdor: Reburninated</em> to be complete!</p>

  <p>With that out of the way, here''s what''s been added this time. Mostly polish,
  but also some new features:</p>

  <h3>New Versions:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Ported to Linux!</strong></li>

  </ul>

  <h3>New Additions:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Upgraded Sound Test menu to <strong>Theater menu</strong>. In addition to listening
  to sounds, you can now watch the game''s cutscenes.</li>

  <li><strong>Added two new overlays</strong>. In addition to Strong Bad''s basement,
  you can now play Trogdor on your Compy, or from the land of Strong Badia!</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Fixes + Polish:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Added <strong>Uncapped FPS</strong> option. This replaces the 90/120/144 FPS
  options from earlier versions.</li>

  <li><strong>Added VSync and fixed a frame pacing bug at max FPS</strong>. Earlier
  versions ran slightly faster than intended depending on the frame rate. This issue
  should now be fixed when running the game at your screen''s refresh rate (probably
  60, or just choose Uncapped to be safe), and should be somewhat remedied for frame
  rates lower than max.</li>

  <li><strong>Remade+upscaled overlay and menu graphics</strong> from 240p to 480p
  on supported systems</li>

  <li>Cheats are now allowed in all difficulty presets; however, enabling a cheat
  disables high scores</li>

  <li>Cheats are no longer immediately enabled upon unlock</li>

  <li>Rearranged some menu settings; most notably, Other Settings has been moved up
  and renamed to Gameplay Settings</li>

  <li>Fixed text on main screen remaining small after changing scaling</li>

  <li>Minor text changes</li>

  <li>Polish and code cleanup</li>

  <li>[PC] Key to toggle fullscreen has been changed from <code class="notranslate">ESC
  or F</code> to <code class="notranslate">ESC, F11, or R3 on controller</code></li>

  <li>[WII] Added analog input for Classic Controller</li>

  <li>[3DS] Changed the .cia version''s icon to match the .3dsx version</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>'
