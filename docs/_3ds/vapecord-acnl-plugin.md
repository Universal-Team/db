update_notes: '<h1 dir="auto">Merry Christmas, here a new version!</h1>

  <h2 dir="auto">New Features:</h2>

  <h3 dir="auto">House Editor!</h3>

  <p dir="auto">The House Editor allows you to upgrade your house/rooms instantly,
  no need to skip a day or save and quit the game!<br>

  It will simulate the house upgrade script from the game to keep the save state correct.
  This means that when you upgrade the house to a specific size, you will for example
  unlock Lyle in Nooks Homes just like you would when you upgrade it normally through
  the game.</p>

  <p dir="auto">You can also edit the exterior of your house!<br>

  No need to input or memorize any ID''s, every exterior option is listed with its
  name (for example: fairy-tale door)!<br>

  The names will be in the language of your game!</p>

  <h3 dir="auto">Fast Player Select Improvements!</h3>

  <p dir="auto">The Fast Player Select cheat now also spams the A Button to skip over
  the dialog from Isabelle even faster!<br>

  It will also block any inputs by the user while its spamming the A Button to ensure
  the user doesn''t delete their town accidentally.</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">Bug Fixes:</h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fixed not being able to pickup flowers/stones/trees/weed after closing the 3ds
  lid</li>

  <li>Touch warp crashing when digging something up</li>

  <li>Light Switch &amp; Secret Storage not showing up on the island</li>

  <li>Fast Isabelle breaking Fast Game Speed &amp; Fast Game Text</li>

  </ul>'
