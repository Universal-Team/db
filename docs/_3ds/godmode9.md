update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Is it really that time of the year again? Six years ago,
  on March 22nd of the faraway year of 2016, GodMode9 was first released to the public.
  It has come a long way, reaching high stability and amassing features. Right now,
  there''s not much left that GodMode9 can''t do, and there''s only the odd bug coming
  in from time to time. As such, this release is a rather small one, with only bugfixes
  and maintenance stuff.</p>

  <p dir="auto">I still wanted to celebrate the day with a release, so here is GodMode9
  v2.1.1 with these changes:</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>[improved] Improved installation of DSiWare games (thanks <a class="user-mention
  notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/Epicpkmn11/hovercard"
  data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/Epicpkmn11">@Epicpkmn11</a>)</li>

  <li>[scripting] Faster script loading as well as other improvements and fixes (thanks
  <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/aspargas2/hovercard"
  data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/aspargas2">@aspargas2</a>)</li>

  <li>[fixed] Fixed a nasty bug when trimming certain DS cart dumps</li>

  <li>[fixed] Some smaller bugfixes and general code maintenance</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>How do I update GodMode9?</strong><br>

  (This may be the last time I tell you how to in the release notes, so please remember)
  You wouldn''t believe how often we get that question when we do a new release. It''s
  actually very simple: Just replace <code class="notranslate">GodMode9.firm</code>
  on your SD card with the file found in the release ZIP. You may also want to update
  scripts, which are found in the <code class="notranslate">./gm9</code> folder inside
  the archive and go to the same folder on your SD card.</p>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>Special thanks</strong><br>

  I''ll be honest, I''ve long given up mentioning everyone here. The sheer number
  of contributors (developers, people who report bugs or suggest features, people
  who help with advice or web hosting...) after 6 years of development is just too
  big. Just know, each and every contribution, no matter how big or small is highly
  appreciated. For this release, special thanks go to <a class="user-mention notranslate"
  data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/Wolfvak/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click"
  data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/Wolfvak">@Wolfvak</a>,
  who''s been a main dev with me for almost all of the lifetime of GodMode9, to <a

  and dumps and to <a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"

  GodMode9 (great catch!).</p>'
