update_notes: '<h1 dir="auto">PLEASE READ -&gt; SET YOUR TIME ZONE CORRECTLY IN ROSALINA
  MENU IF THE SERVER WILL NOT CONNECT! THANK YOU</h1>

  <p dir="auto">If you had a lot of games in your Citrahold directory, the menu would
  be really long and hard to scroll. I''ve changed the way it''s displayed so that
  it''s a little nicer to use.</p>

  <p dir="auto">It also now reattempts to connect to the server if it immediately
  fails. Connection failure is common if you boot Citrahold 3DS immediately after
  starting up the 3DS. Reconnecting usually fixes it.</p>

  <p dir="auto">SET YOUR TIME ZONE CORRECTLY IN ROSALINA MENU IF THE SERVER WILL NOT
  CONNECT! THANK YOU</p>

  <p dir="auto">You can scan this QR Code in FBI to install it.<br>

Citrahold provides you with everything you need to easily move game saves from a physical 3DS to a 3DS emulator on your computer (and vice versa).

It basically allows you to cloud-sync your saves for if you like to play a game across a real 3DS and an emulator.

Please visit [the website](https://www.citrahold.com/) for much more information! It has everything you need in order to set it up.

Checkpoint (or another competent save manager) and an Internet connection are also required.
