Allows playing your physical or digital games on an emulator without having to dump them.

- Play games from your console without having to dump them, with purchased updates and DLC.
- Sync the savedata/extdata of the broadcasted game during the play session.
- Use the console as the input device by enabling the Artic Controller feature on the emulator.
- Load shared ext data and NCCH archives from your console.
- Remove the need to dump keys, as the decryption is done by the console's OS.
