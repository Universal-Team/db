Yet another "Flappy Bird" mobile game homebrew recreation for Nintendo 3DS (old/new)
**But with Vertical Orientation**.

And also some gameplay features different from the original game.

## Game

*   **Tap bottom screen** or **press D-PAD or B** to flap between the pipes.
*   Game's speed is increasing for each score point.
*   For every 25 points you will earn a new medal - **bronze, silver, gold and platina** for 99 score.
*   Your best score is save in game and stored at path: SD:/config/millkeny/flappy.dat. You also can clear your save data from in-game menu.

## Special Thanks

*   [BlyZeDev](https://github.com/BlyZeDev) - For SD filesystem logic from his [T-Rex-Game-3DS](https://github.com/BlyZeDev/T-Rex-Game-3DS).
*   Dong Nguyen, .GEARS - for this legendary game and original assets.
