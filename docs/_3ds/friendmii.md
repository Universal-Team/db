update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This is more of a proof of concept, open source friend
  application than a fully functional application. Things are still quite limited
  but in working condition for now. <em>The only advantage to this, is that it lets
  you search for friends in your friends list which seems to be the one thing the
  friends app doesn''t do</em>.</p>

  <p dir="auto">FriendMii consists of the following features:</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Displays friend list. (Use L/R to switch between your friend card and friends
  list)</li>

  <li>Add/remove friends from your friends list.</li>

  <li>Search for friends by their name. (Perhaps more filters later :P)</li>

  <li>Displays friend current playing/favourite title ID, titleID. (Yeah I know doesn''t
  look very nice but it works)</li>

  <li>Displays friend''s comment as well as their friend code.</li>

  <li>Displays owner''s friend code, favourite game, comment etc, online status, hide
  status etc.</li>

  </ul>

  I''d really appreciate it! <a href="https://www.paypal.me/Joel16IA" rel="nofollow">https://www.paypal.me/Joel16IA</a></strong></p>'
