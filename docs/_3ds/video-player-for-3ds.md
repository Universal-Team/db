  High RAM build (only for <code class="notranslate">.cia</code>) has been added for

  <p dir="auto"><strong>Fixed bugs</strong> <br>

  Many minor bugs that may cause crash have been fixed. <br>

  Random crash on hardware decorder has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/Core-2-Extreme/Video_player_for_3DS/issues/69"
  data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/Core-2-Extreme/Video_player_for_3DS/issues/69/hovercard">#69</a>).
  <br>

  Auto-playing video after coming back from Nintendo''s home menu and keyboard even
  it was previously paused has been fixed. <br>

  AV desync on more than 2ch audio has been fixed.</p>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>About high RAM cia</strong> <br>

  <code class="notranslate">..._high_ram.cia</code> can use more RAM than normal <code
  class="notranslate">.cia</code> and <code class="notranslate">.3dsx</code>, this
  can reduce chance of getting <code class="notranslate">out of (linear) memory</code>
  errors. <br>

  When you open/close it your 3DS will reboot so it may take a while to open/close
  the app, and you can''t use the Internet browser while you are using it.</p>
