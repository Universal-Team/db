update_notes: '<p dir="auto"><del>"This release doesn''t have as much, quick and crappy
  interim release."</del></p>

  <p dir="auto">"This update contrary to the previous statement, addeds quite a bit.
  I (erievs) was not aware that the changes were in the main repo already. If i would
  have known I''d named this Beta 35. <strong>Big shoutout to 2ipper who added quite
  a lot to this release</strong>.</p>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>TO PEOPLE WHO ARE UPDATING PLEASE SWITCH TO ANDROID VR IN
  THE ADVANCE TAB IN SETTINGS YOUR SETTINGS WON''T BE AUTO UPDATED, ANDROID VR WILL
  ONLY BE DEFAULT IF YOU DIDN''T HAVE ANY SAVE DATA</strong></p>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>### Changelog</strong><br>

  <strong>erievs &amp; Smu1zel (helped me build the release) &amp;&amp; 2ipper (a
  lot)</strong></p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Add the current version to the update header in settings updater.</li>

  <li>Switched the default agent from Android to Android VR, so videos will play again,
  do note VR does NOT support YouTube kids content. A better solution is being worked
  on, this is a stopgap update really.</li>

  <li>A lot more, I''ll update as I learn more, oops.</li>
