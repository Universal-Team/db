update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This release doesn''t have as much, but it should fix
  video playback for most users.</p>

  <h1 dir="auto"><strong>Changelog</strong></h1>

  <p dir="auto"><strong>Smu1zel</strong></p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>The screen timeout feature now only turns off the bottom screen. This means
  you no longer have to set it to Never to make the app usable.</li>

  <li>The iOS client has been removed in favor of Android (with some iOS parameters
  since that works for some reason). This works with all videos that the iOS client
  originally supported. visionOS should no longer be preferred due to YouTube blocking
  Kids videos on it as of September or so. If you used it as a workaround in 33, please
  switch back. This may also fix video playback in certain regions, but I don''t know
  for certain.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 dir="auto">This also marks the first anniversary of FourthTube. Thank you all
  for using it!</h3>'
