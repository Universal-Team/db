update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Initial release. Extract your Data Folder or .rsdk to
  /3ds/SonicMania. Some things to keep in mind:</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>New 3DS only at the moment. Old 3DS support is planned for future releases,
  however.</li>

  <li>Load times are pretty bad, mainly due to the 3DS''s slow read speeds. This will
  be addressed in a future release.</li>

  <li>Menu strings are corrupted when running the game in Data Folder mode, however,
  everything else runs fine.</li>

  <li>Plus DLC not included. The decomp has no way of verifying whether you''ve actually
  purchased the DLC, and thus, you must compile the port yourself to access it.</li>

  <li>CRT filters are not and likely will never be supported by the port. It''s still
  referenced in the video options menu, but changing it has no effect.</li>

  </ul>
