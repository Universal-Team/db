  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Merged latest luma commits (<a href="https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v13.1.2">view
  changelog</a>)</li>

  <li>Added a part of the Plugin Selector from <a href="https://github.com/Tekito-256/Luma3DS">Tekito-256''s
  fork</a>.

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Support for default.3gx was added (this wasn''t on the original fork).</li>

  <li>This is tested on old and new 3DS and worked fine, if you have any issue with
  this, please open a issue.</li>

  <li>Options and rearrange isn''t included because it caused issues (that also are
  on the original fork) and didn''t work. This means the menu will open every time
  you have multiple plugins and you can''t set one by default (which isn''t that annoying).</li>

  <li>If you need to test/check plugins, please consider using their fork! This fork
  is meant for this and have other tools than plugin selector.</li>

**Starlight3DS** is a fork of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) with the goal of adding more features. This was inspired and took from [DullPointer](https://github.com/DullPointer)'s Luma3DS fork and updated on the latest Luma3DS version.
This modified Luma3DS adds many features such as Day/Night mode (lite), shortcuts to toggle certain things like wifi or bottom screen, cut wifi in sleep mode to save battery, QOL improvements and more!
You can view the full list of added features in the [Readme of the github repository](https://github.com/cooolgamorg/Starlight3DS?tab=readme-ov-file#changes-with-the-official-build)
