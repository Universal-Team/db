update_notes: '<p dir="auto">I have remade the port with the current upstream source
  code so there is countless bug fixes.<br>

  The best new feature is limited mod support.<br>

  I have bundled keen 4 and the pre converted mod Keen7 so there is no need to download
  the files for them yourself.</p>

  <p dir="auto">I hope you all enjoy!</p>'
