YAMKC 3DS is a Mario Kart game clone for the 3DS, made with the intention to mimic the feeling of a Mario Kart game using Mario Kart 7 as the inspiration. Due to limited time to finish this project, only basic behaviour is implemented and the only available game mode is time trials on a single circuit.
