In this short, arcade-y game for your Nintendo 3DS explore the famous Lewiatan grocery store of Księżomierz and flex your tape-wrapping skills as the clock is ticking!

You play as Adam a.k.a. "Taśman". You came to the local Lewiatan of Księżomierz to promote your brand - TAŚMAN™ Sealed. But it's Kasia's shift today and she won't allow it! Wrap as many items in your duct tape and get back in Zakre's Seiac before the guards catch you!
