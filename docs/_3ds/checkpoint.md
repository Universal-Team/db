update_notes: '<p dir="auto">I intended to add more value to this release by trying
  to enhance few things here and there, but I didn''t manage to do it in the short
  time I had to get this build ready. I hope to bring something new and fresh to Checkpoint
  soon to keep the spark of this project alive.</p>

  <p dir="auto">Sometimes I wish I could write this software from scratch again to
  incorporate into it all the cool things and concepts I learned in the last 10 years
  of being a Software Engineer. But focus switches from one thing to another, interests
  change and, most importantly, time and energy are very limited in this moment in
  time.</p>

  <p dir="auto">But there will be another moment again, in which the spark will burn
  at full power.</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">What''s new</h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li><strong>Fixed: breaking compatibility issue with latest Switch OS version.</strong></li>

  <li>Fixed: compiled with latest version of the needed dependencies.</li>

  <li>Added: cheat database updated to latest <a href="https://github.com/FlagBrew/Sharkive">Sharkive</a>
  release.</li>

  <li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user''s experience.</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">If you wish to contribute, pull requests are highly appreciated.</p>
