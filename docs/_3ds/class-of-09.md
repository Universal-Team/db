update_notes: '<h3 dir="auto">v1.0</h3>

  <p dir="auto">I made a bunch of bug changes in September, but I didn''t compile
  a list of changes and I have forgotten. The one bug I know I fixed for certain is
  the facing direction visual bug. The .cia has a new better banner, still not 3D
  however.</p>

  <p dir="auto">In order to try submitting this game to the Universal-DB, builds seem
  to have to be hosted on Github, so (at least for now) they are.</p>'

A demake/port of the visual novel "Class of '09" to the 3DS. 

More than feature complete, you miss nothing playing this version over the PC version.
