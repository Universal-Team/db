update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This is another hotfix of the 1.3.7.1, but now for the
  homebrew Nintendo Switch version of the game: it was found that game is unable to
  start at all, it fails to initialise the OpenGL renderer. But this update resolves
  this problem and game starts just normally. The OpenGL backend has been switched
  from Desktop OpenGL API to the OpenGL ES 2+ since newer firmware removes the desktop
  OpenGL support.</p>

  <p dir="auto">This post contains Nintendo Switch only build, for other platforms,
  you can download packages <a href="https://github.com/TheXTech/TheXTech/releases/tag/v1.3.7.1">at
  the main post here</a>. Also, all the binaries had been updated at the main post
  to prevent users downloading faulty builds without knowlege of that.</p>

  <h2 dir="auto">Changelog:</h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fixed the startup crash on OpenGL render initialization, now the OpenGL ES 2+
  is used instead (<a class="user-mention notranslate" data-hovercard-type="user"

This is a direct continuation of the SMBX 1.3 engine. Originally it was written in VB6 for Windows, and later, it got ported/rewritten into C++ and became a cross-platform engine. It completely reproduces the old SMBX 1.3 engine (aside from its Editor), includes many of its logical bugs (critical bugs that lead the game to crash or freeze got fixed), and also adds a lot of new updates and features. The original SMBX assets are not included, but a compatible preservation asset packs are available from wohlsoft.ru.
