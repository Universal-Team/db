update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Hi.<br>

  It''s been a while</p>

  <p dir="auto">Anyway here''s what''s new :</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added preset loading</li>

  <li>Added per pattern mode selection (sleeping or awake)</li>

  <li>Overall new menu layout</li>

  <li>Preparing for the next updates (low battery pattern and file loading)</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">There are some regression with colors not correctly displayed on the
  text, this comes from a devkitpro update and i''ve sent a bug report for it</p>

  <p dir="auto">Again, sorry for being this late but hey look i didn''t abandon this
  i told you.<br>

  The next updates should hopefully cover the low battery pattern (which i have, i
  just need to make a good menu/conversion for it) and the pattern loader from a file.</p>

  <p dir="auto">If you find any bug or anything, please make an issue or tag me on
  discord about it</p>

  <p dir="auto">Have fun :)</p>

# CtrRGBPAT2
This 3DS application allows the LED color to be changed. In order for this to work, Luma CFW (custom firmware) needs to be installed.
Thanks to [CPunch](https://github.com/CPunch/CtrRGBPATTY/) for the original project !

## Features
Customize the LED color and pattern for when you receive notifications ! Whether SpotPass, StreetPass, online Friends, or more (Yes, there's more) ! Why keep the default blue when you can have a cool-looking purple for example ðŸ˜Ž

Everything is simple and made so you cannot possibly screw something up (or else you really wanted to)

## Upcoming
- Save and restore feature
- Proper UI ?

Hope you enjoy ! :)
