A customizable yacht dice game for the 3ds using lovepotion!
You can create your own dice sets and scoresheets with a yaml file, place it in the same directory as the game for PC, and in `sdmc:/3ds/custom-yacht-3ds`. See the [default.yaml](https://github.com/chalenged/custom-yacht-3ds/blob/main/default.yaml) file for an example with comments.
