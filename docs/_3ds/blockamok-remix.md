update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Here''s another update! Probably the last one unless
  a bug needs to be fixed.</p>

  <h3 dir="auto">Changes</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added <strong>widescreen</strong>! (Or whatever your system''s fullscreen is.)
  Overlay options are still present if you''d prefer to play with a square aspect
  ratio.

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Widescreen may result in slightly worse performance on some systems, but New
  3DS is the only one where it''s actually noticeable in my experience.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Added <strong>three new background/overlay color options</strong> and <strong>one
  new block color option</strong>.

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Also reorganized background/overlay color options.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Added <strong>Spawn Area setting</strong> that allows the player to change the
  size of the block spawn area.

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>A larger area will be more visually appealing but have worse performance on
  weak devices. Conversely, a smaller area will look more cramped but improve framerate.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Adjusted HUD element positions.</li>

  <li>Assorted minor polish.</li>

  <li>[Android] <strong>Increased block spawn boundaries</strong> from 10.0 to 12.0
  (same as PC).</li>

  <li>[PC] Config file now stores WINDOW_WIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT instead of just WINDOW_SIZE
  (which previously set both width and height).</li>

  <li>[Switch] Very slightly increased block spawn boundaries from 8.7 to 8.8.</li>

  <li>[Vita] Slightly <strong>improved performance</strong>. Minimum no-overclock
  framerate increased from ~45 FPS to ~52 FPS.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 dir="auto">Bug Fixes</h3>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>High score is no longer saved if debug mode is used during a game. No cheating!</li>

  <li>[Android] <strong>Fixed startup crash</strong> on some Android versions.</li>

  <li>[PC] Toggling fullscreen no longer resets visual settings.</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">Enjoy!</p>'

Fly through a 3D world of never-ending blocks and survive for as long as you can! Includes customization options for gameplay and visuals, along with five music tracks.

New 3DS is recommended; performance is poor on O3DS.
