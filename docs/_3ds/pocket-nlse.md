update_notes: <p dir="auto">First stable version of Pocket-NLSE. Additional features
  will be added later, but I felt it needed an "official" release. Bugs were fixed,
  unstable options were hidden, icon was changed. As before, the .3dsx requires you
  include the .xml file in the same directory as the .3dsx in order for it to work.
  The .cia does not require a .xml file.</p>
