CrossCraft-Classic is a project that implements Minecraft Java Edition: Classic without looking at any of the source code of the original application and without using the original copyrighted assets. All knowledge is figured out with an understanding of in-game mechanics and is approximated to be as close as possible to the original. This project is NOT a clone of Minecraft, it is a fully implemented client.
