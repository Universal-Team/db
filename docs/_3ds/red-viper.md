update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This patch includes a number of accuracy improvements,
  primarily related to timing (plus a few game-specific hacks where hardware research
  is insufficient). With these improvements in tow, Red Viper is currently the most
  accurate emulator for Virtual Boy games on any system, even disregarding the whole
  3D thing.</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Improved timer emulation to fix sample playback in Galactic Pinball and Teleroboxer</li>

  <li>Added memory access time emulation, which fixes numerous games

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fixes sample playback in Virtual Bowling and Niko-Chan Battle, along with improved
  timer emulation</li>

  <li>Improves emulation performance in 3D Tetris</li>

  <li>Correctly emulated game speed in Golf</li>

  <li>Fixes Blox 2 intro cutting off early</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Fixed graphical glitches and fixed intro chime in Waterworld</li>

  <li>Improved audio emulation to fix some homebrew, including the Blox games and
  the Formula V demo</li>

  <li>Allow loading savestates from older versions</li>

  </ul>'
