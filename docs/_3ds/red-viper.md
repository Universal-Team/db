update_notes: '<p dir="auto">This release introduces local multiplayer!</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Added local multiplayer

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Accessible from the main menu</li>

  <li>Two nearby 3DS systems can play Virtual Boy games together</li>

  <li>Games can be loaded from the SD card, or downloaded from the host system</li>

  <li>Forwarders can only play the game they were configured with</li>

  <li>Save data is saved and loaded per system</li>

  <li>The input buffer can be manually adjusted: higher values may be more stable
  in noisy environments, but incur longer delays</li>

  <li>Because both Virtual Boy simulations are ran on both 3DS systems, games may
  slow down sometimes if either player is using an old 3DS. The following games are
  confirmed to play well on old 3DS:

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Mario''s Tennis multiplayer patch</li>

  <li>Hyper Fighting</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Improved loading savestates from old versions</li>

  </ul>'
