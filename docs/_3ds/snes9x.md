update_notes: '<ul dir="auto">

  <li>Improved sound synchronization.</li>

  <li>Added BlargSNES DSP Core (experimental) for performance. The original Snes9X
  DSP core (default) suffers from sound skipping in some games like Aladdin and Gradius
  3. You can choose which DSP core to use from the Options menu. The BlargSNES DSP
  Core sounds similar to the Snes9x Core for most games. Sounds like Final Fantasy
  3''s the howling wind sound different.</li>

  <li>Added support for Tengai Makyou Zero English Patch (for hopefully all future
  versions)</li>

  </ul>'
