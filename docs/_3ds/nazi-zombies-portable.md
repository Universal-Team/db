A Quake-based "demake" of the 'Nazi Zombies' mode from Call of Duty: World at War.

Feature-equivalent with Call of Duty: World at War on a generic level. Gameplay components are implemented, with minor parity differences. Most World at War maps and their gimmicks are not yet represented. Minor features from Call of Duty: Black Ops are also present.

Features "Nacht der Untoten" and many maps created by the Community, bundled in.
