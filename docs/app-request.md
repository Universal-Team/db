# App Request

Please fill out the form below to generate a JSON for adding to the database, then submit it as a Pull Request or Issue on GitHub. Please note that this form is for submition of existing applications to the database, not requesting that applications be created.

Note that this form while this form is good for most apps, it does not support everything that Universal-DB can have on an app. Most notably, **arbitrary scripts** and **handling files inside archives** are not currently a part of this form. If your app has a direct `.3dsx`, `.cia`, `.nds`, etc file in the GitHub release the output of this form will be 100% ready to go. If you have a zip or other archive you will need to manually add the `archive` tag to the JSON. This will likely be added to the form at a later date.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask for help on our [Discord server](https://universal-team.net/discord) or create your Issue/PR before you've got the JSON complete.
