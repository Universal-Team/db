This is also the default UniStore for [Universal-Updater](/3ds/universal-updater), so if you'd like to browse and install apps from Universal-DB directly on your 3DS you should give it a try.

On the Nintendo DSi there are two options for downloading apps from Universal-DB. <a href="/ds/dsidl">dsidl</a> can use the QR codes on the site or <a href="/ds/kekatsu">Kekatsu</a> which functions fully on device. If you have not used Kekatsu before, place this <a href="/assets/files/databases.txt" download="databases.txt">databases.txt</a> in <code>sd:/Kekatsu/</code>.
