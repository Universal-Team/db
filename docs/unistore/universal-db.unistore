**it's just an EXE and audio**~ **UPDATE: Reverted as of 8/23/24**\n  - Additionally, the non-Visual Studio Windows makefile actually works now, and there's a new x86 makefile to go with it\n  - If you want to compile it yourself, Visual Studio is still an option\n- [Other] Scaling options are now frozen/unfrozen based on display resolution instead of being hardcoded per-system\n  - This doesn't affect current releases, but it does make scaling options one less thing to worry about when porting to other systems\n  - PC still allows all options regardless of display because of windowed mode\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**UPDATE 8/23/24**: Reverted statically linked DLLs in Windows releases;

"This release mostly adds in a lot of missing error checks and adds in gamecard support + support for mismatched regions.\n\nThis release would not have been possible without the help of @Sonlen1414 .\n\n![QR code][0]\n\n\nChanges:\n- Closes #1 (no gamecard support). Thanks to astronautlevel for the bug report and Sonlen for testing my fixes. If a gamecard is found, it is chosen over any local installation.\n- Closes #2 (no support for mismatched regions). Thanks to astronautlevel for this bug report. You are now prompted if the program detects multiple regions. If there is only one region, it is autodetected and you are not prompted.\n- Closes #4 (no support for missing save files). The program only allows you to choose existing save files. If there is only one save file, it is autodetected and you are not prompted to select a save file.\n- Restart functionality! You can at any point now press the L button to restart the entire process. Useful if you selected the wrong save file or region.\n- Savedata readouts! After selecting a save file, the program now reads out the current state of the save file and shows it on the bottom left screen.\n- Cleaner interface! The main text prompts by the program are now dedicated on the top screen. The bottom screen now contains a list of save data info on the left and a list of your choices made in the program on the right (this include autodetection).\n\nUnder the hood changes (you probably don't care about this but for my own memory it's here):\n- Loads and loads. Really, I've rewritten about 90% of the program logic except for the ctrulib function calls themselves.\n- No more if blocks. The entirety of the state machine is now handled with a `switch`.\n- Got rid of editprofile.c completely and split it up into various functions inside save.c with lowid selection getting moved to title.c.\n- Dedicated failure state that is separate from SUCCES state.\n\n[0]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13433513/38756013-40d03e2e-3f68-11e8-96cb-83704530de74.gif", "screenshots": [], "title": "SRAU", "version": "v1.1", "wiki": ""}}, {"[prerelease] EDuke3D.cia": {"script": [{"file": "EDuke3D.*\\.zip", "includePrereleases": true, "output": "/EDuke3D.zip", "repo": "masterfeizz/EDuke3D", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/EDuke3D.zip", "input": "", "output": "/", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "EDuke3D.cia", "includePrereleases": true, "output": "/EDuke3D.cia", "repo": "masterfeizz/EDuke3D", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/EDuke3D.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/EDuke3D.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}, {"file": "/EDuke3D.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "type": "prerelease"}, "[prerelease] eduke3d.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "EDuke3D.*\\.zip", "includePrereleases": true, "output": "/EDuke3D.zip", "repo": "masterfeizz/EDuke3D", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/EDuke3D.zip", "input": "", "output": "/", "type": "extractFile"}, {"new": "%3DSX%/eduke3d.3dsx", "old": "/3ds/eduke3d/eduke3d.3dsx", "type": "move"}, {"file": "/EDuke3D.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "type": "prerelease"}, "info": {"author": "Felipe Izzo", "category": ["game"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "Unofficial port of EDuke32 for the Nintendo 3DS", "icon_index": 32, "last_updated": "2016-05-08 at 04:36 (UTC)", "license": "gpl-2.0", "releasenotes": "Bugfixes (mostly memory management) and first CIA release.\nView README on the project page for instructions.\nCIA bugs:\nGame must be closed from quit option on the menu, and not from the 3ds home menu\nHome button only works when in a level", "screenshots": [], "title": "EDuke3D", "version": "v1.0-beta", "wiki": ""}}, {"info": {"author": "Floogle", "category": ["emulator"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "A Virtual Boy emulator for the 3DS", "icon_index": 33, "last_updated": "2024-12-17 at 21:08 (UTC)", "license": "", "releasenotes": "This patch introduces anaglyph mode, render time emulation, and numerous bugfixes.\nRender time emulation means that some in-game sequences run at the same speed they did on a real Virtual Boy, which no previous emulator has emulated accurately.

This will be addressed in a future release.\n- Menu strings are corrupted when running the game in Data Folder mode, however, everything else runs fine.\n- Plus DLC not included. The decomp has no way of verifying whether you've actually purchased the DLC, and thus, you must compile the port yourself to access it.\n- CRT filters are not and likely will never be supported by the port.

We worked long and hard on this update, and we finally ready to present this big update for you all! This update will be the biggest in TheXTech's history and features a huge set of features, bugfixes, and improvements.\n\nThank you to @0lhi who served on our core development team for design and quality assurance from version v1.3.4 (2021) to v1.3.7 (2025). His contributions are much appreciated.\n\n**EDIT: A small hotfix for PortMaster has been released very soon: https://github.com/TheXTech/TheXTech/releases/tag/v1.3.7-hotfix1**\n\n# Most important changes\n\n* **Widescreen and small-screen support, done right.** No hacks, no editing `luna.lua`, no broken spawns. Play all of your favorite SMBX 1.3 content at your device's native resolution for a smooth and polished \"remaster\" experience, while the engine keeps track of which important items would have been onscreen (or offscreen!) in SMBX 1.3.\n\n* **Classic playstyle for classic content.** Disable TheXTech's unnecessary bugfixes and new features to play your SMBX 1.3 content the way its authors intended it, or go totally Vanilla (at your own risk).\n\n* **An options overhaul.** No more editing `thextech.ini`, every single game setting can be changed in the new in-game options menu.\n\n* **Refined player select.** A huge thank you to Savby for reimagining our text-based player select menus with an intuitive and colorful interface that feels right at home on your TV.\n\n* **Multiple asset packs.** TheXTech is good for more than just SMBX, and now you can conveniently switch between asset packs within the engine itself. Just add your extra asset packs to the assets subdirectory in your TheXTech folder, and switch by holding select at the main menu.\n\n* **Beta 4P support.** Ever wanted to play Battle Mode with 3 of your best frenemies? Now you can! This version introduces shared and split screen 4-player co-op and split screen 4-player battle. Please share your feedback and experiences with us so we can make it better!\n\n# Full changelog for 1.3.7\n\n<details>\n\n## New features:\n\n### The multi-res system\n\n* Added support for different display resolutions (@ds-sloth)\n* Allow event logic NPCs to consider SMBX 1.3 camera when activating, guarded by compat flag modern-npc-camera-logic (@ds-sloth)\n* Add npc.txt attribute \"usedefaultcam\"; set this to \"1\" to force NPCs to use the event logic camera to activate and \"0\" to force them to use the visible camera (@ds-sloth)\n* Add compat.ini setting \"dynamic-camera-logic\" which may be disabled to force a level to use the 800x600 camera for all logic (@ds-sloth)\n* Added internal support for more than 2 cameras (@ds-sloth)\n* Added backdrop for levels smaller than the screen at `graphics/ui/Backdrop.png` (@ds-sloth)\n* Added alternative format for world map frame with better support for various display resolutions (@ds-sloth)\n\n### Menus\n\n* Redesigned character select screen for multiplayer game start and player setup (@Savbyn, @ds-sloth)\n* Overhaul the Main Menu and in-game Options menu with support for editing all \"thextech.ini\" options (@ds-sloth)\n* Add \"Modern\", \"Classic\", and \"Vanilla\" playstyles which determine which bugfixes and gameplay updates are applied (@ds-sloth, @0lhi)\n* Add ability to start speedrun in-game by pressing Select when making a new game save (@ds-sloth, @0lhi)\n* Add ability to change last warp resume setting on hub worlds.

Alternatively, the latest release of [DeSmuME][1] is slightly easier to setup and supports [emulating rumble][2].\n\nTo run this on melonDS, you'll need to go into the Emulator Config -> DLDI -> Enable DLDI, since this uses the homebrew nitrofile system.

You can download the game ROM by scanning the QR code below in your loader's menu, if your system supports this. Please make sure you use v1.0.3+, or your game may crash on startup!\n\n![QR code for installing the game on a DSi/3DS with TwilightMenu][3]\n\n### Unsupported platforms\nThis *won't work on the Wii U Virtual Console emulator*.

completes what I wanted to do for a long time - use linear algebra for all the transforms in the game! This allows for some fun things like panning the camera around and doing tilt properly. It also simplifies the game logic (in a crazy kind of way) so that the core logic doesn't have to worry about rotations. \n\nI tried implementing this a few years ago but ran into roadblocks, then abandoned the idea altogether. Since I'm active in this codebase again, I figured I'd give it a second shot!\n\nAlso, despite using the additional math for the matrix transformations, the Nspire release still runs great!\n\nNew features for this release:\n\n* all: New title menu before the level select\n* all: Camera pans and color transitions between most states\n* switch: You can now use \"X\" to rotate right, like the 3ds\n\nUnder the hood features:\n\n* all: Drivers cleaned up to officially use \"Pimpl\"\n* all: Drivers no longer make excessive pointer de-references and instead direct calls to the Impl itself\n* all: Drivers now have \"Surface\" classes that contain core rendering logic, split out from Platform\n* all: Game uses new SurfaceGame class, which implements software matrix transforms\n* all: Code cleanup, where applicable\n\nNote: This was a large refactor.

Move all save state files to directory /3ds/uae3DS/save/ on your SD card\n2. Rename the files to `<ADF file name>-<NR>.asf` where `<ADF file name>` is the name of the disc image in drive DF0 at the time of writing the state file and `<NR>` is the save state number (0 - 3), e.g. `Chaos Engine, The_Disk1.adf-0.asf`\n\n**Installation:**\n- Put your kick.rom file in directory /3ds/uae3DS on your 3DS SD-card. It must be called kick.rom, be a kickstart 1.3 image, and be the 512KB overdumped version.\n- Install CIA with [FBI][0], run 3dsx from homebrew launcher (put 3dsx file in /3ds/uae3DS dir) or run 3ds from flash card.\nApart from this, a DSP-dump is required for sound to work correctly in the CIA version.\nhttps://gbatemp.net/threads/dsp1-a-new-dsp-dumper-cia-for-better-stability.469461/\n\n**Emulator usage:**\n- SELECT: open menu\n- START: Toggle SuperThrottle\n- Bottom Screen: Virtual

revamp: screenshots, config saved in save states, ...\n- enhancement: SHIFT, Amiga & ALT keys now differentiate left and right press\n- enhancement: option to move mouse with C-Pad, configurable in main menu\n- enhancement: added list of 10 last used disk images in \"Load disk image\"-menu\n- optimization: settings are autosaved on exit\n- optimization: removed sound settings from main menu\n-

As of now, it's only for the 3DS/2DS family. Everything is working : You can scan any amiibo you want with your DS, whether normal (locked) or unlocked and it will recognize it\n\nAlongside it is a modified build of TagMo which essentially disable writing the lock bits onto your NFC tags. (You will have to uninstall the actual TagMo beforehand if you have it, otherwise Android will not let you update as I signed the APK with my own keys since i don't know the ones used for TagMo)\nSo you can rewrite over an unlocked tag as many times as you want, and change it's figurine anytime.\nBut keep in mind as of now the save data inside the tag is deleted too if you rewrite it (although only a few games uses save data onto amiibos)\n\nBefore making an issue saying it's not working, please make sure you :\n- Installed the correct patch \n- Activated \"Enable game patching\" And \"Allow custom firmware\" in Luma3DS settings (hold SELECT on console startup)\n- Used the modified TagMo to flash either : a blank NFC tag, or an already rewritable amiibo nfc Tag. Classic amiibos you flashed with the official TagMo will not be able to be rewritten\n\nIf you have any other problem, then create an issue so i can help you fix it.\n\nHave fun !", "screenshots": [], "title": "NFCheckRem", "version": "3ds", "wiki": ""}}, {"info": {"author": "Adrian Siekierka", "category": ["emulator"], "console": ["3DS", "NDS"], "description": "NDS/3DS fork/port of the uxn/Varvara virtual machine", "icon_index": 201, "last_updated": "2024-07-26 at 18:11 (UTC)", "license": "mit", "releasenotes": "* [NDS] Updated to BlocksDS 1.3.1.", "screenshots": [], "title": "uxnds", "version": "v0.5.2", "wiki": "https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html"}, "uxnds.3dsx": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/uxnds.3dsx", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_debug.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_debug.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_debug.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_profile.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_profile.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_profile.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}]}, {"gameyob.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Stewmath/GameYob/releases/download/v0.5.2/gameyob.zip", "output": "/gameyob.zip", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/gameyob.zip", "input": "gameyob.cia", "output": "/gameyob.cia", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/gameyob.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/gameyob.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}, {"file": "/gameyob.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "612 KiB"}, "gameyob.nds": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Stewmath/GameYob/releases/download/v0.5.2/gameyob.zip", "output": "/gameyob.zip", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/gameyob.zip", "input": "gameyob.nds", "output": "%NDS%/gameyob.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/gameyob.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "612 KiB"}, "info": {"author": "Stewmath", "category": ["emulator"], "console": ["NDS"], "description": "[Super] Gameboy [Color] emulator for the Nintendo [3]DS", "icon_index": 202, "last_updated": "2020-10-05 at 13:52 (UTC)", "license": "mit", "releasenotes": "This is from the \"v0.5-hotfix\" branch, not the \"master\" branch.

time of the year again? Six years ago, on March 22nd of the faraway year of 2016, GodMode9 was first released to the public. It has come a long way, reaching high stability and amassing features. Right now, there's not much left that GodMode9 can't do, and there's only the odd bug coming in from time to time. As such, this release is a rather small one, with only bugfixes and maintenance stuff.\n\nI still wanted to celebrate the day with a release, so here is GodMode9 v2.1.1 with these changes:\n* [improved] Improved installation of DSiWare games (thanks @Epicpkmn11)\n* [scripting] Faster script loading as well as other improvements and fixes (thanks @aspargas2)\n* [fixed] Fixed a nasty bug when trimming certain DS cart dumps\n* [fixed] Some smaller bugfixes and general code maintenance\n\n**How do I update GodMode9?**\n(This may be the last time I tell you how to in the release notes, so please remember) You wouldn't believe how often we get that question when we do a new release. It's actually very simple: Just replace `GodMode9.firm` on your SD card with the file found in the release ZIP. You may also want to update scripts, which are found in the `./gm9` folder inside the archive and go to the same folder on your SD card.\n\n**Special thanks**\nI'll be honest, I've long given up mentioning everyone here. The sheer number of contributors (developers, people who report bugs or suggest features, people who help with advice or web hosting...) after 6 years of development is just too big. Just know, each and every contribution, no matter how big or small is highly appreciated.

Can be used in local play.\n\n## Changes:\n- _Occasional holes_ game mode now makes holes more common. Went from 1/80 chance of appearing to about 1/20.\n- _At least one bot is required to play one-player_ while waiting for others to join. This is to make highscore more fair. If you can play on your own without a bot, the highscore would be easy to rig.\n- The game now goes back to the Start Menu when the game ends. Press start to leave the game.\n- _The options menu has become a sub-menu_. To access game modes, press Select at the Start Screen or End-of-Round Screen to access the Options menu, then select Game Modes, and press A. Press B to exit a menu.\n- _There is a Difficulty Menu for the bots_. From the new Options Menu, select the 2nd option (highlight it in yellow), and press A. Try using direction buttons and A to select and change things here. Press B to go back one scene.\n- _There is a hidden bot settings menu_. Hold L and press R at the Difficulty Menu. This will let you adjust fine details of each bot. However, if you go to the regular Difficulty Menu, it will reset their settings to default.\n- _Autopilot_ is also a bot, but it plays for you. Press L in-game to toggle. This bot has fixed settings: 100% precision, 0% aggressiveness, 30% patience. This means it will never go fast, but it is relatively difficult to kill in one-player. In local play, it can be killed a little easier due to limitations of its algorithm. \n- Bots can't grasp concepts like _Enable R_, but it utilizes common concepts like _holding A or B_, _teleporting the apple with Y_, and going through holes in \"Occasional holes\". The precision of the bot determines the likelihood of turning precisely. Insane and Autopilot share the highest precision, followed by Hard, Medium, then Easy difficulty settings.\n\n## Bug fixes:\n- _Frame drop on o3ds has been fixed_\n- _The rare crashing of the game has been fixed_\n- _Running into a boundary in game mode \"Boundaries Kill\" now displays what killed you._\n- _Snakes are less likely to cross paths now and live to tell the tale._\n- When you change your name, _it only says \"Welcome, [name]\" once_.\n- _The screen score no longer duplicates_ when text scrolls on the bottom screen console during gameplay.\n- _Closing the lid on your console with Snakes running will not crash the game anymore_. Pressing the Home button with the cia version running will not crash the game anymore.\n- Going in reverse will no longer kill you.\n\n**Just a note**: this game does not run very well on old 3ds models. It is playable, but with 3 bots playing at once, the o3ds has severe frame-drop. I am trying to find the source of this problem. It only occurs on the o3ds and o3dsxl.
