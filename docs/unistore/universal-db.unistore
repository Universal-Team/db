Alternatively, the latest release of [DeSmuME][1] is slightly easier to setup and supports [emulating rumble][2].\n\nTo run this on melonDS, you'll need to go into the Emulator Config -> DLDI -> Enable DLDI, since this uses the homebrew nitrofile system.

You can download the game ROM by scanning the QR code below in your loader's menu, if your system supports this.

Just note NTR Launcher will boot the target NDS file in NTR mode!\n* New audio files added for new menu.\n* HBMenu UI loaded by default if booted with no cart inserted.\n* INI file folder now located in NTR_Launcher folder instead. A default ini file from NitroFS (if mount of nitrofs succeeds) will be copied to SD if one is not present. A set of default stage2 launchers for common cards found to not work from the cart launcher also will be copied if not present on SD.\n* Stage2 launchers are expected to be in NTR Launcher folder though you can navigate to any folder you want in the UI so stage2 launchers aren't the only thing this can be used for. You can also use this as a means of booting homebrew off SD in NTR mode.\n* New option added to INI file for autobooting to new cart menu for those who want it as default.\n* Debug mode now moved to Left + Right shoulder button combo on boot instead of B button.\n* B button used to toggle booting into new cart stage2 menu.

This will be addressed in a future release.\n- Menu strings are corrupted when running the game in Data Folder mode, however, everything else runs fine.\n- Plus DLC not included. The decomp has no way of verifying whether you've actually purchased the DLC, and thus, you must compile the port yourself to access it.\n- CRT filters are not and likely will never be supported by the port.

All have been tested on hardware. This is primarily a release for the TI-Nspire but I'll upload new builds here to keep them up to date.\n\nAs for the TI-Nspire build the credits and beatmaps are not currently working.\n\n⚠️ Install: Copy `haxagon.tns` AND `levels.haxagon.tns` into the `ndless` folder ⚠️\n\n### A summary:\n\nI've finally come back to what started my programming adventure. A simple app for a calculator. In 2013 I released the program \"Super Hexaspire\" as an alpha. At the time I had no idea that programming would turn into a career.\n\nSo here we are today, porting a game around to so many different platforms. Starting with the Nspire, moving to the 3DS, then to PC, then to the Switch, and finally back to the Nspire. Super Haxagon has been quite a project over the years and taught me many things about technology, and for that I am grateful. \n\n### Timeline:\n\n2013: TI-Nspire version Alpha\n2016: 3DS version 1\n2017: 3DS version 2 (Complete Rewrite)\n2020: 3DS version 3 (Complete Rewrite)\n2020: Windows and Linux release\n2020: Nintendo Switch release\n2021: TI-Nspire release\n\n### Thanks for playing!", "screenshots": [{"description": "Gameplay 1", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/super-haxagon/gameplay-1.png"}, {"description": "Gameplay 2", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/super-haxagon/gameplay-2.png"}, {"description": "Gameplay 3", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/super-haxagon/gameplay-3.png"}, {"description": "Gameplay 4", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/super-haxagon/gameplay-4.png"}], "title": "Super-Haxagon", "version": "3.4.0", "wiki": ""}}, {"info": {"author": "Edoardo Lolletti", "category": ["utility", "save-tool"], "console": ["NDS"], "description": "Homebrew to dump and inject savefiles from original game cards on dsi", "icon_index": 51, "last_updated": "2018-08-24 at 15:35 (UTC)", "license": "gpl-3.0", "releasenotes": "What's new\n- Fixed some tyos in the prompts\n- Added support for fake cards, now it should be able to dump saves from bootleg games too", "screenshots": [], "title": "ndsi-savedumper", "version": "1.2", "wiki": ""}, "savedumper.nds": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/edo9300/ndsi-savedumper/releases/download/1.2/savedumper.nds", "output": "%NDS%/savedumper.nds", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "493 KiB"}}, {"info": {"author": "rayasticot", "category": ["game"], "console": ["NDS"], "description": "Explore the city of Bohicon and talk to the villagers ! /!\\ A bit of gore (low-resolution) /!\\", "icon_index": 52, "last_updated": "2022-02-16 at 18:01 (UTC)", "license": "", "releasenotes": "![kiriback][0]\n\n\n[0]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88832503/154327256-9b319436-796f-40fa-9a2f-fde44bec05df.png", "screenshots": [], "title": "kirikou", "version": "v1.0.2", "wiki": ""}, "kirikou.nds": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/rayasticot/kirikou/releases/download/v1.0.2/kirikou.nds", "output": "%NDS%/kirikou.nds", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "4 MiB"}, "kirikou2.nds": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/rayasticot/kirikou/releases/download/v1.0.2/kirikou2.nds", "output": "%NDS%/kirikou2.nds", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "7 MiB"}}, {"A5200DS.nds": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/wavemotion-dave/A5200DS/releases/download/3.6/A5200DS.nds", "output": "%NDS%/A5200DS.nds", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "420 KiB"}, "info": {"author": "AlekMaul / wavemotion-dave", "category": ["emulator"], "console": ["NDS"], "description": "Atari 5200DS - Emulator for the DSi and above based on Alekmaul's work", "icon_index": 53, "last_updated": "2024-01-08 at 12:22 (UTC)", "license": "", "releasenotes": "V3.6 : 08-Jan-2024 by wavemotion-dave\n\n- Internal database updated to include known prototypes, hacks and other sundry 5200 games.\n- Codebase cleanup across the board.\n- Improved key debounce to fix lots of games including Star Raiders (which has a new overlay).\n- Color Artifacting added for the few games that utilize it (Choplifter, etc.)", "screenshots": [], "title": "A5200DS", "version": "3.6", "wiki": ""}, "readme.md": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/wavemotion-dave/A5200DS/releases/download/3.6/readme.md", "output": "/readme.md", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "22 KiB"}}, {"Install the Pirate Launcher": [{"message": "This will replace the boot.3dsx in the root of\nyour SD card, replacing the Homebrew\nLauncher with the Pirate Launcher.\nContinue?", "type": "promptMessage"}, {"file": "boot.3dsx", "includePrereleases": false, "output": "sdmc:/boot.3dsx", "repo": "Alexyo21/the-pirate-launcher", "type": "downloadRelease"}], "info": {"author": "devkitPro, cooolgamer, Fra", "category": ["utility"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "The Pirate Launcher joke from the Wii, now on 3ds!

Colors should no longer look too dark regardless of the colorProfile setting. Note that due to wildly varying color temperatures and LCD types this will not make GBA games look exactly like on your monitor with or without color correction. Also note that the gamma curve is not a perfect fit for IPS New 3DS XL consoles since they have very bad gamma near shadows but it's a very noticeable improvement nonetheless.\n* A side effect of the new gamma correction is that the gbaGamma, lcdGamma, brightness and contrast settings are disabled for now. They will be reimplemented in the color profile settings later.\n\nExample of what the gamma curve correction does. The brighter version is roughly how the top LCD shows colors without correction.\n![3ds_top_lcd_correction][0]\n\n**Full Changelog**:

I may make another update if a bug needs to be fixed, and I'm not ruling out the possibility of ports to additional systems (those would be added to this release after the fact), but consider _Trogdor: Reburninated_ to be complete!\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what's been added this time. Mostly polish, but also some new features:\n\n### New Versions:\n- **Ported to Linux!**\n\n### New Additions:\n- Upgraded Sound Test menu to **Theater menu**. In addition to listening to sounds, you can now watch the game's cutscenes.\n- **Added two new overlays**. In addition to Strong Bad's basement, you can now play Trogdor on your Compy, or from the land of Strong Badia!\n\n### Fixes + Polish:\n- Added **Uncapped FPS** option. This replaces the 90/120/144 FPS options from earlier versions.\n- **Added VSync and fixed a frame pacing bug at max FPS**. Earlier versions ran slightly faster than intended depending on the frame rate. This issue should now be fixed when running the game at your screen's refresh rate (probably 60, or just choose Uncapped to be safe), and should be somewhat remedied for frame rates lower than max.\n- **Remade+upscaled overlay and menu graphics** from 240p to 480p on supported systems\n- Cheats are now allowed in all difficulty presets; however, enabling a cheat disables high scores\n- Cheats are no longer immediately enabled upon unlock\n- Rearranged some menu settings; most notably, Other Settings has been moved up and renamed to Gameplay Settings\n- Fixed text on main screen remaining small after changing scaling\n- Minor text changes\n- Polish and code cleanup\n- [PC] Key to toggle fullscreen has been changed from `ESC or F` to `ESC, F11, or R3 on controller`\n- [WII] Added analog input for Classic Controller\n- [3DS] Changed the .cia version's icon to match the .3dsx version\n\nEnjoy!", "screenshots": [{"description": "Gameplay", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/trogdor-reburninated/gameplay.png"}], "title": "Trogdor: Reburninated", "version": "v2.2", "wiki": ""}}, {"Demo-Reset.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/NPXTobi/Demo-Reset/releases/download/1.0.0/Demo-Reset.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/Demo-Reset.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "1 MiB"}, "Demo-Reset.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/NPXTobi/Demo-Reset/releases/download/1.0.0/Demo-Reset.cia", "output": "/Demo-Reset.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/Demo-Reset.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/Demo-Reset.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "1 MiB"}, "info": {"author": "NPX-I7/Tobi", "category": ["utility"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "This app resets the democounter of the 3ds", "icon_index": 104, "last_updated": "2020-07-16 at 15:14 (UTC)", "license": "", "releasenotes": "The first version of Demo-Reset.

Six years ago, on March 22nd of the faraway year of 2016, GodMode9 was first released to the public. It has come a long way, reaching high stability and amassing features. Right now, there's not much left that GodMode9 can't do, and there's only the odd bug coming in from time to time. As such, this release is a rather small one, with only bugfixes and maintenance stuff.\n\nI still wanted to celebrate the day with a release, so here is GodMode9 v2.1.1 with these changes:\n* [improved] Improved installation of DSiWare games (thanks @Epicpkmn11)\n* [scripting] Faster script loading as well as other improvements and fixes (thanks @aspargas2)\n* [fixed] Fixed a nasty bug when trimming certain DS cart dumps\n* [fixed] Some smaller bugfixes and general code maintenance\n\n**How do I update GodMode9?**\n(This may be the last time I tell you how to in the release notes, so please remember) You wouldn't believe how often we get that question when we do a new release. It's actually very simple: Just replace `GodMode9.firm` on your SD card with the file found in the release ZIP. You may also want to update scripts, which are found in the `./gm9` folder inside the archive and go to the same folder on your SD card.\n\n**Special thanks**\nI'll be honest, I've long given up mentioning everyone here. The sheer number of contributors (developers, people who report bugs or suggest features, people who help with advice or web hosting...) after 6 years of development is just too big. Just know, each and every contribution, no matter how big or small is highly appreciated. For this release, special thanks go to @Wolfvak, who's been a main dev with me for almost all of the lifetime of GodMode9, to @aspargas2 who did maintenance and fixed bugs, to @Epicpkmn11, who improved the save game generation and thus the installation for DSiWare CIAs and dumps and to @giiutfff who catched a really nasty bug happening when trimming certain DS cart dumps in GodMode9 (great catch!).", "screenshots": [], "title": "GodMode9", "version": "v2.1.1", "wiki": "https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/wiki"}}, {"[prerelease] flappy3ds.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Komas19-new/flappy3DS/releases/download/v0.1.9/flappy3ds.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/flappy3ds.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "184 KiB", "type": "prerelease"}, "[prerelease] flappy3ds.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Komas19-new/flappy3DS/releases/download/v0.1.9/flappy3ds.cia", "output": "/flappy3ds.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/flappy3ds.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/flappy3ds.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "800 KiB", "type": "prerelease"}, "info": {"author": "Komas19", "category": ["game"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "Flappy3DS is an Flappy Bird clone for 3DS", "icon_index": 119, "last_updated": "2023-05-29 at 16:42 (UTC)", "license": "gpl-3.0", "releasenotes": "**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Komas19-new/flappy3DS/compare/v0.1.8...v0.1.9\n\nThis is a bug fix version only!\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n* Fixed the ``+`` being gone in each option in options menu\n* Fixed the death count not increasing when dying to the ground\n* Fixed that if the ground is too high, you die instantly\n* Fixed saving!\n\n# Known Issues\n\n* I am aware that some lines glitches out on loading when dying, however, this does not apply to emulators, this bug was seen in an Old 2DS, possibly other too.\n\n# Supported Emulators\n* Citra Nightly 1807\n* Citra Nightly 1913\n\n## FBI QR CODE:\n![qr-code][0]\n\n[0]: https://github.com/Komas19-new/flappy3DS/assets/82937056/ca16bfc3-d3d6-4977-bfbe-ef420178f5f1", "screenshots": [], "title": "Flappy3DS", "version": "v0.1.9", "wiki": ""}}, {"3DEins.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DEins/releases/download/v0.2.0/3DEins.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/3DEins.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "1 MiB"}, "3DEins.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DEins/releases/download/v0.2.0/3DEins.cia", "output": "/3DEins.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/3DEins.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/3DEins.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "1 MiB"}, "DSEins.nds": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DEins/releases/download/v0.2.0/DSEins.nds", "output": "%NDS%/DSEins.nds", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "907 KiB"}, "DSEins.nds.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DEins/releases/download/v0.2.0/DSEins.nds.cia", "output": "/DSEins.nds.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/DSEins.nds.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/DSEins.nds.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "921 KiB"}, "[nightly] 3DEins.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/raw/master/builds/3DEins/3DEins.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/3DEins.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "type": "nightly"}, "[nightly] 3DEins.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/raw/master/builds/3DEins/3DEins.cia", "output": "/3DEins.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/3DEins.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/3DEins.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "type": "nightly"}, "info": {"author": "Universal-Team", "category": ["game"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "A Card game for Nintendo 3DS & DS(i)!", "icon_index": 120, "last_updated": "2020-06-20 at 15:33 (UTC)", "license": "gpl-3.0", "releasenotes": "## DSEins, the NDS version of 3DEins is now included as well!\n\n## What's new?\n\n### DSEins\n- Add the initial release of DSEins, the NDS version of 3DEins! This is it's first release, so it could be buggy, feel free to report bugs, if there are any on the issue section or on the Universal-Server [here][0].\nNOTE: This release is NOT really much graphical, but the next version will be better for sure.\n\n### 3DEins\n- Add a draw and play animation (can be enabled / disabled in the Settings.)\n\n### 3DEins & DSEins\n- Use DSEins / 3DEins-Core which is made by me, StackZ. The core includes a proper cardset of 108 cards.. like the regular game! So that way.. you cannot have like 6 times Draw 4 which is a nice improvement to the old version!\n\n- Added Single Player mode with AI!\n\n- Full Translations of: Bruh, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese and Russian!\n\n## How to update\n### DSEins\n* Download `DSEins.nds` and put it to your SD Card.\n* Start it using Twilight Menu++ or whatever you like.\n**3DS User: You can install the CIA as well, but you need the NDS file as well into the root or at `sd:/_nds/DSEins/`.**\n\n### 3DEins\n* Download `3DEins.3dsx` or `3DEins.cia` and put it to your SD Card.\n* If downloading the CIA, install it using FBI. If 3dsx, open it using the Homebrew Launcher.\n\n### We hope you enjoy using DSEins & 3DEins v0.2.0! ~Universal-Team\n\n[0]: https://discord.gg/KDJCfGF", "screenshots": [{"description": "Char selection", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/3deins/char-selection.png"}, {"description": "Ingame", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/3deins/ingame.png"}, {"description": "Main menu", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/3deins/main-menu.png"}], "title": "3DEins", "version": "v0.2.0", "wiki": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DEins/wiki"}}, {"Cthulhu.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Ryuzaki-MrL/Cthulhu/releases/download/1.3.5/Cthulhu.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/Cthulhu.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "229 KiB"}, "info": {"author": "Lázaro Vieira", "category": ["utility"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "Homebrew alternative to Nintendo's dev unit software", "icon_index": 121, "last_updated": "2019-11-28 at 09:08 (UTC)", "license": "gpl-3.0", "releasenotes": "Small release that adds an option to set play coins to 300, the system's cap.\n\nThis codebase is old and will likely not be updated again.", "screenshots": [], "title": "Cthulhu", "version": "1.3.5", "wiki": ""}}, {"craftus_reloaded.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/RSDuck/craftus_reloaded/releases/download/0.3/craftus_reloaded.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/craftus_reloaded.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "387 KiB"}, "craftus_reloaded.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/RSDuck/craftus_reloaded/releases/download/0.3/craftus_reloaded.cia", "output": "/craftus_reloaded.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/craftus_reloaded.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/craftus_reloaded.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "548 KiB"}, "info": {"author": "Kemal Afzal", "category": ["game"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "A second attempt at a homebrew Minecraft clone for 3DS", "icon_index": 122, "last_updated": "2020-11-18 at 00:15 (UTC)", "license": "other", "releasenotes": "Meanwhile here's a new release", "screenshots": [], "title": "Craftus Reloaded", "version": "0.3", "wiki": "https://github.com/RSDuck/craftus_reloaded/wiki"}}, {"info": {"author": "Lordus", "category": ["emulator"], "console": ["NDS"], "description": "A Sega Genesis/MegaDrive emulator for the Nintendo DS", "icon_index": 123, "last_updated": "2008-07-12 at 17:41 (UTC)", "license": "", "releasenotes": "", "screenshots": [], "title": "jEnesisDS", "version": "v0.7.4", "wiki": ""}, "jEnesisDS.nds": {"script": [{"file": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/files/JEnesisDS0174.zip", "output": "/JEnesisDS0174.zip", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/JEnesisDS0174.zip", "input": "jEnesisDS.nds", "output": "%NDS%/jEnesisDS.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/JEnesisDS0174.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "135 KiB"}}, {"LeafEdit.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/LeafEdit/releases/download/v0.2.1/LeafEdit.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/LeafEdit.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "2 MiB"}, "LeafEdit.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/LeafEdit/releases/download/v0.2.1/LeafEdit.cia", "output": "/LeafEdit.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/LeafEdit.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/LeafEdit.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "2 MiB"}, "[nightly] LeafEdit.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/raw/master/builds/LeafEdit/LeafEdit.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/LeafEdit.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "type": "nightly"}, "[nightly] LeafEdit.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/raw/master/builds/LeafEdit/LeafEdit.cia", "output": "/LeafEdit.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/LeafEdit.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/LeafEdit.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "type": "nightly"}, "info": {"author": "Universal-Team", "category": ["utility", "save-tool"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "Work in progress Animal Crossing: New Leaf save manager & editor for the Nintendo 3DS!", "icon_index": 124, "last_updated": "2020-09-05 at 17:30 (UTC)", "license": "gpl-3.0", "releasenotes": "# After like 75% of this year, another release is there.\n\n## What's new?\n- Added initial Wild World support.\n- Implemented an Update Center.

(Use Checkpoint for backup and restore instead.)\n- Rewrite the core.\n- UI style changes.\n- Switched selections to lists for now.\n- English only for now until the core is completely done.\n- Changed assets, so you need an Internet Connection on first startup on this version.\n\n## This is version 0.2.1, because it doesn't have much changes and for v0.3.0, it is not ready yet.\n\n# The wiki will get an update later for the latest changes.

Thanks to astronautlevel for the bug report and Sonlen for testing my fixes. If a gamecard is found, it is chosen over any local installation.\n- Closes #2 (no support for mismatched regions). Thanks to astronautlevel for this bug report. You are now prompted if the program detects multiple regions. If there is only one region, it is autodetected and you are not prompted.\n- Closes #4 (no support for missing save files). The program only allows you to choose existing save files. If there is only one save file, it is autodetected and you are not prompted to select a save file.\n- Restart functionality! You can at any point now press the L button to restart the entire process. Useful if you selected the wrong save file or region.\n- Savedata readouts! After selecting a save file, the program now reads out the current state of the save file and shows it on the bottom left screen.\n- Cleaner interface! The main text prompts by the program are now dedicated on the top screen.

Can be used in local play.\n\n## Changes:\n- _Occasional holes_ game mode now makes holes more common. Went from 1/80 chance of appearing to about 1/20.\n- _At least one bot is required to play one-player_ while waiting for others to join. This is to make highscore more fair. If you can play on your own without a bot, the highscore would be easy to rig.\n- The game now goes back to the Start Menu when the game ends. Press start to leave the game.\n- _The options menu has become a sub-menu_. To access game modes, press Select at the Start Screen or End-of-Round Screen to access the Options menu, then select Game Modes, and press A. Press B to exit a menu.\n- _There is a Difficulty Menu for the bots_. From the new Options Menu, select the 2nd option (highlight it in yellow), and press A. Try using direction buttons and A to select and change things here. Press B to go back one scene.\n- _There is a hidden bot settings menu_. Hold L and press R at the Difficulty Menu. This will let you adjust fine details of each bot. However, if you go to the regular Difficulty Menu, it will reset their settings to default.\n- _Autopilot_ is also a bot, but it plays for you. Press L in-game to toggle. This bot has fixed settings: 100% precision, 0% aggressiveness, 30% patience. This means it will never go fast, but it is relatively difficult to kill in one-player. In local play, it can be killed a little easier due to limitations of its algorithm. \n- Bots can't grasp concepts like _Enable R_, but it utilizes common concepts like _holding A or B_, _teleporting the apple with Y_, and going through holes in \"Occasional holes\". The precision of the bot determines the likelihood of turning precisely. Insane and Autopilot share the highest precision, followed by Hard, Medium, then Easy difficulty settings.\n\n## Bug fixes:\n- _Frame drop on o3ds has been fixed_\n- _The rare crashing of the game has been fixed_\n- _Running into a boundary in game mode \"Boundaries Kill\" now displays what killed you._\n- _Snakes are less likely to cross paths now and live to tell the tale._\n- When you change your name, _it only says \"Welcome, [name]\" once_.\n- _The screen score no longer duplicates_ when text scrolls on the bottom screen console during gameplay.\n- _Closing the lid on your console with Snakes running will not crash the game anymore_. Pressing the Home button with the cia version running will not crash the game anymore.\n- Going in reverse will no longer kill you.\n\n**Just a note**: this game does not run very well on old 3ds models. It is playable, but with 3 bots playing at once, the o3ds has severe frame-drop. I am trying to find the source of this problem. It only occurs on the o3ds and o3dsxl.

This will be updated soon.*\n\n[0]: https://github.com/NotTheOnlyRph/MontyHallDS/assets/169435186/1f779308-acab-4449-a58d-d8ab46d0040f", "screenshots": [], "title": "Monty Hall DS", "version": "v1.0", "wiki": ""}}, {"SavvyManager.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/RocketRobz/SavvyManager/releases/download/v3.4.0/SavvyManager.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/SavvyManager.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "41 MiB"}, "SavvyManager.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/RocketRobz/SavvyManager/releases/download/v3.4.0/SavvyManager.cia", "output": "/SavvyManager.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/SavvyManager.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/SavvyManager.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "42 MiB"}, "info": {"author": "RocketRobz", "category": ["utility", "save-tool"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "An editor/save manager for the Girls Mode/Girls Style/Style Savvy/Style Boutique games, on Nintendo 3DS", "icon_index": 183, "last_updated": "2023-12-26 at 02:22 (UTC)", "license": "mit", "releasenotes": "### What's new?\n- Added a WIP feature where you can import characters from Styling Star's save data into Fashion Forward.\n- Character shading can now be changed for Styling Star!\n- Added a .ini-only setting to force a specific region for a game.\n    - The setting is called `REGION`, which should be added under `[SS1]`, `[SS2]`, `[SS3]`, or `[SS4]` depending on which game you play.\n    - Numbers for the setting are `0` for JPN, `1` for USA, `2` for EUR, `3` for AUS, `4` for CHN, and `5` for KOR.\n\n### Bug fixes\n- Fixed some fashion items not being added to Fashion Forward.\n- Fixed Keisha missing from the Fashion Forward character list.\n- Fixed detecting met people from G to I in SS3/SS4 twice.\n- Correct game logo(s) are now shown for existing save file(s).", "screenshots": [{"description": "Character change menu", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/savvymanager/character-change-menu.png"}, {"description": "Game select", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/savvymanager/game-select.png"}, {"description": "Import character", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/savvymanager/import-character.png"}], "title": "SavvyManager", "version": "v3.4.0", "wiki": ""}}, {"3DSident-GUI.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/joel16/3DSident/releases/download/0.8.0/3DSident-GUI.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/3DSident-GUI.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "203 KiB"}, "3DSident-GUI.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/joel16/3DSident/releases/download/0.8.0/3DSident-GUI.cia", "output": "/3DSident-GUI.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/3DSident-GUI.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/3DSident-GUI.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "556 KiB"}, "3DSident.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/joel16/3DSident/releases/download/0.8.0/3DSident.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/3DSident.3dsx", "type": "downloadFile"}], "size": "186 KiB"}, "3DSident.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/joel16/3DSident/releases/download/0.8.0/3DSident.cia", "output": "/3DSident.cia", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/3DSident.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/3DSident.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "522 KiB"}, "info": {"author": "Joel", "category": ["utility"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "PSPident clone for 3DS", "icon_index": 184, "last_updated": "2018-08-03 at 06:02 (UTC)", "license": "zlib", "releasenotes": "I think the time has arrived to close the doors on this project.

Thanks to everyone who were a part of this. \n\n**Both:**\n- Now displays NAND as well as the original local friend code seed. (Useful to know if you've switched your friend code seed before) \n- Removed a bunch of unused functions as well as the screenshot feature. (You should be able to use Rosalina now).\n- Based off the latest devkitARM toolchain. Both versions are also under one branch now and can be compiled together. \n- CIA versions include the new boot logos by FrozenFire\n\n**Original Version:**\n- Added some features from the GUI version - Now displays mac address for all 3 WiFi slots, card slot status and initial firmware version.\n\n**GUI Version:**\n- Integrated 3DSident button tester. (Use start + select to activate/deactivate)\n- Now uses Citro2D and up-to-date tool chain functions as well as many under the hood improvements.\n- Slight improvements to UI to make it sort of similar to the Switch version.\n\n*Original:*\n![image][0] \n\n*GUI:*\n![image][1]\n\n**If you'd like to support me, then feel free to buy me a coffee, I'd really appreciate it! https://www.paypal.me/Joel16IA**\n\n[0]: https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjoel16%2F3DSident%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2F0.8.0%2F3DSident.cia&chs=180x180&choe=UTF-8&chld=L|2\n[1]: https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjoel16%2F3DSident%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2F0.8.0%2F3DSident-GUI.cia&chs=180x180&choe=UTF-8&chld=L|2", "screenshots": [{"description": "Kernel", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/3dsident/kernel.png"}, {"description": "Storage", "url": "https://db.universal-team.net/assets/images/screenshots/3dsident/storage.png"}], "title": "3DSident", "version": "0.8.0", "wiki": ""}}, {"info": {"author": "Adrian Siekierka", "category": ["emulator"], "console": ["3DS", "NDS"], "description": "NDS/3DS fork/port of the uxn/Varvara virtual machine", "icon_index": 185, "last_updated": "2024-07-26 at 18:11 (UTC)", "license": "mit", "releasenotes": "* [NDS] Updated to BlocksDS 1.3.1.", "screenshots": [], "title": "uxnds", "version": "v0.5.2", "wiki": "https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html"}, "uxnds.3dsx": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/uxnds.3dsx", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_debug.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_debug.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_debug.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "uxnds_profile.nds": [{"file": "uxnds\\d+\\.zip", "output": "/uxnds.zip", "repo": "asiekierka/uxnds", "type": "downloadRelease"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxnds_profile.nds", "output": "%NDS%/uxnds_profile.nds", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "input": "uxn", "output": "/uxn", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/uxnds.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}]}, {"Pocket-NLSE.3dsx": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/dragos240/Pocket-NLSE/releases/download/v1.0.0/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "output": "/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "input": "Pocket-NLSE/Pocket-NLSE.3dsx", "output": "%3DSX%/Pocket-NLSE.3dsx", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "1 MiB"}, "Pocket-NLSE.cia": {"script": [{"file": "https://github.com/dragos240/Pocket-NLSE/releases/download/v1.0.0/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "output": "/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "type": "downloadFile"}, {"file": "/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "input": "Pocket-NLSE/Pocket-NLSE.cia", "output": "/Pocket-NLSE.cia", "type": "extractFile"}, {"file": "/Pocket-NLSE.cia", "type": "installCia"}, {"file": "/Pocket-NLSE.cia", "type": "deleteFile"}, {"file": "/Pocket-NLSE-v1.0.0.zip", "type": "deleteFile"}], "size": "1 MiB"}, "info": {"author": "Nat Osaka", "category": ["utility", "save-tool"], "console": ["3DS"], "description": "A portable save editor for Animal Crossing: New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS", "icon_index": 186, "last_updated": "2017-01-11 at 13:18 (UTC)", "license": "gpl-3.0", "releasenotes": "First stable version of Pocket-NLSE.

Here is a little explanation on each term:\n## 3dsx/cia\nThe **3dsx** file can be launched from the homebrew launcher while the cia files can be installed to the home menu. (There is only a single 3dsx file variation.)\n## Mode3\nFiles which have the the **Mode3** label are made specifically for extended memory games on Old 3DS/2DS models. (To detect if you are using an extended memory game, check if the console reboots after you close it from the home menu.) **You don't need to install the Mode3 version if you don't want to use any extended memory game or you have a New 3DS/2DS.**\n## Home Menu Banner\nThe banner is the 3D model that shows in the top screen when you select the app in the home menu. The difference is only visual and is up to your own choice.

3DS.\n\n**Features:**\n- Two independent and fast VNC-viewers for 3DS top and bottom screen\n- Streaming audio client (mp3 over HTTP)\n- Cemuhook server for serving 3DS controler and motion data to clients (e.g. Cemu)\n- UDP-Feeder client to serve 3DS controler and motion data to remote vJoy via [vJoy-udp-feeder][0]\n- supports server or client side scaling if VNC screen size is too big\n\n**Installation:**\nInstall CIA with [FBI][1], run 3dsx from homebrew launcher (put 3dsx file in /3ds/vice3DS-C64 dir) or run 3ds from flash card.\nApart from this, a DSP-dump is required for sound to work correctly in the CIA version.\nhttps://gbatemp.net/threads/dsp1-a-new-dsp-dumper-cia-for-better-stability.469461/\n\n**Usage:**\nDuring first start, TinyVNC will write its config files to the SD card.
